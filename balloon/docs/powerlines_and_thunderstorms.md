**FOREWORD**


The purpose of this series of publications is to provide the general


aviation flying public with information that may improve aircraft
operational safety. Because of the increasing activity in balloon


operations. and the increase in accidents involving balloons, safety tips for
balloon pilots will be included in the Accident Prevention Program
pamphlet series. This particular pamphlet identifies certain hazards
associated with the operation of hot air balloons and provides suggested
safety procedures to minimize the accident potential.

**A New Problem Emerges To Complicate Traditional Hazards**


This article is addressed expressly to ex-

perienced balloonists, (pilots. crew and
friends). The information in the article is
presented as information concerning possible
hazards. Discussion of hazards is an effective
way to reduce or eliminate their occurrence.
Unfortunately, the frank presentation of facts
could create the wrong impression to new en
thusiasts. The actual incidence of the type of
accident specifically referred to in this article
is perhaps one in one-half million operations.
However, the gravity of this accident is such
that any incidence of this accident is un
satisfactory. Traditional hazards of fire and
power line collision can be even more
dangerous if your balloon envelope has a self
closing def.lation valve.


dangerous. I have maintained for a long period
of time that in terms of over-all safety that the
self-closing valves are inherently superior to
valves which cannot be reclosed by the pilot
while in flight. The safety of non-reclosing
valves has been very good; however, the basic


Fatal accidents have occurred where the
balloon envelope was uncontrollably heated by
a large on-board fire, thereby resulting in a
more serious accident than the fire alone might
have created. Self-closing valves require cons
tant restraint to deflate the envelope. Pilots and
crew cannot, in every case, function con
tinuously during a large fire to insure that the
balloon envelope deflates as fast as possible in
order to reach the safety of the ground. The in
ability to exhaust the envelope heat created by
ascend a large on-board fire causes the envelope to altitudes beyond the safe level which to
the occupants can ·abandon the balloon.
There may be a number of methods to over-

come this problem. Certainly a system of secur
ing the valve line in an open position together
(steel core) line are the principal areas with a fire resistant which need study. Many good.ideas
will be advanced as corrective measures, and a
few will be produced as actual hardware. ·
However. hardware 1s not the purpose of this
article. My purpose is to make the reader aware
of the problem and the obviously serious
results.

reasons which caused serious accidents with
non-reclosing valves still exists-only constant
attention to maintenance details cause them to
be safe. Prevention of the circumstances that
cause massive on-board fires is the obvious
best solution to the problem.
The three accidents of which I am aware in-

volving on-board fires, self-closing deflation
valves and fatal conclusions had different
original circumstances. The original cause of
one accident was a break in the main fuel
system piping. Two accidents were caused by
rupture of the fuel system from power line colli
sions.
Balloon fuel systems are not well protected
because the design must accommodate the
necessity to remove major components of the
system for storage (i.e., burners, tanks and
hoses). Some manufacturers have better
designs than others; however, there is no cur
rent design which fully protects the fuel system
from all the possible abuse which can occur in
balloon operation. Ultimately, the pilot must
take responsibility for the safety of the fuel
system. The area of greatest concern is that the
system resist a major fuel line or valve break. A
major leak in a high pressure propane system is
an opening approximately twice the diameter
of a common pin. It is important that fuel hose
arrangements be protected from the balloon
occupants particularly at connections to tank

highly desirable, will not always be possible.
Each of us will at some time in our balloon fly
ing career make a serious in-flight decision
about power line contact. This decision will be
hard, perhaps terrifying and very serious.

Knowing that collision with a power line
must occur in a precise way in order to
minimize personal injury is a big part of the
decision criteria. Acting quickly is also
necessary. The decision involves "burn" or
"rip". Emotionally, all pilots will want to "burn"
because if you can fly over the wires-missing
them completely-there are no complications
once safe passage occurs. The nagging prob·
lem is predicting absolutely that you can clear
the power lines. On the other hand, ripping is a
safer decision because there is almost no

body contact by the pilot or passengers. These
short pieces of pipe act as levers which multiply
valve body. It is possible the force to break tank valves in this manner. Brass of the blow on the
fittings have only % the strength of steel for an
equal thickness; therefore, these fittings are the
most suspect and require special attention.
Fuel tanks can be burned through by arcing
power lines. It is unlikely that a pilot can do
much to protect tanks from this exposure ex

c. There is a chance that there could be injury
to the pilot or passengers. Properly prepared
for a heavy landing there is really very little
chance of serious injury. A balloon ripped from
150 feet cannot exceed 1500 feet per minute
descent rate. Landing at 1500 feet per minute is
a hard jolt that can be successfully handled
without injury.
d. Like any hard landing the fuel should be
secured and the pilot light extinguished before
ground contact.

There are other possible problems such as
rebound that could occur. Thinking out the
problem in advance of a real power line colli
sion threat will give the pilot more confidence
to make the correct decision.

**Powerline Safety**


Recently, two Colorado pilots were forced to
jump from their balloon just before it plowed
into powerlines. They were not injured, but the
balloon received extenstve damage. Also
recently, a balloon hit a powerline in Kansas
City. It was damaged. but there were no injuries
to the balloonists. And in east Texas, a balloon
recently deflated across powerlines at sun·

down. The pilot received minor burns and so
did the balloon, but the two passengers
escaped uninjured. ,Again in east Texas, a
balloon was caught in the wind shear du.ring a
landing in a new subdivision and became en
tangled in some wires that fortunately were not
alive with electricity. There were no damages or
mjuries. A balloonist and h1s· passenger were
not so lucky m Wichita last month. They were
killed when the" superpressurized balloon
broke 1ts tether and sailed off into powerlines.
When a long electncal cord hanging down from
the ·basket contacted 69 KV lines, the two
occupants suffered severe electrical burns,
became unconscious, fell out of' the basket,
and were pronounced dead by electrocution.

Each of the.se powerline a·ccidents h.as its
own set of circumstances and causes for hap-


pening. Regardless, each deals a severe blow
to the safety record of the entire ballo.oning
community. For this reason, if for no other, it is
paramount that all pilots take steps to avoid
collision with powerlines. Towards this goal,
some advice and discussion is offered through
this newsletter media.
Just what can happen? If a balloon coniacts
powerlines at the basket, it is possible that the
occupants touchtng any part of the metal
superstructure can be electrocuted. Such contact or fuel could system also result in fire
and explosion if hot wires penetrate a tank or
fuel line. If a balloon makes contact with its
suspension cables, the resultant arcing can
sever the_cables. The occupants are left in free
fall, either with the basket or on their own. Con·
tact at the envelope may cause fabric melting,
partial deflation and some electrical power
transmission to the basket by way of the rip
line, damp load tapes. or the pyrometer cable.
All of these accidents can be avoided if proper
care and precautions are taken.
During launct1ing, powerlines are avoidable
simply by launching downwind of the wires or
at a safe distance upwind of the wires. This is


-----

just common sense and applies to tethering as
well. For crossing powerlines downwind of the
launch site, a good rule of thumb is to allow at
least 100 feet of horizontal separation between
the lines and the balloon for each knot of wind
speed. For example, in a 1 0-knot surface wind,
the launch site should be at least 1,000 feet
upwind. But be conservative in your
estimates-1500 feet would be even better. The
actual crossing should be made with several
hundred feet of vertical clearance. It is even
advisable to cross the line in an ascent. Pay
attention to how heavily loaded the balloon is
and quickly assess your balloon's ability to
climb under the currect conditions. Overloaded
balloons tend to be sluggish and very slow
reacting. Don't forget-an average balloon has
over two tons of inertia!
Do not attempt landings upwind of

powerlines without employing the above
distance minimums. Better yet, it just makes
good sense not to make landings upwind of
powerlines at all; instead, cross them at a safe
altitude and select a more appropriate landing
site. If winds are gusty, thermic or otherwise
unstable, be especially cautious. Under such
conditions, the direction and altitude of the
balloon can change abruptly and safety
margins can dwindle in seconds.


In level flight, keep a constant vigil for


powerlines. They are not easy to see from the
air, especially when viewed against a mixed(~"
background of earth and vegetation. If the wind\ _)_
dies and the balloon is suddenly becalmed over - --
powerlines, climb to a higher altitude to find a
wind that will move the balloon aside. If no
such lateral movement is discovered, carefully
use a drop line and an experienced ground crew


tci pull the balloon out of danger. Keep -in mind
that hemp and nylon, under certain conditions,
have been known to conduct over 500 volts.


Whenever ballooning in the vicinity of


powerlines, use every precaution possible.
Don't take chances. Don't tempt the destruc-


tive potential (no pun intended) of such
innocent-looking wires. Things can happen very
quickly and a not-so-bad situation can rapidly
deteriorate into a gruesome ordeal. Balloonists
right now are pushing their luck. Flights are
getting sloppy and accidents are happening.
For your own safety, the safety of your trusting
passengers, and the reputation of the great
sport of ballooning, be more careful.

**Summer Safety** **in** **the Storm and Thermal Season**


To avoid tragic weather-related experiences
in ballooning, it helps to have some knowledge
of summer thunderstorms and thermals. Never
attempt the destructive potential of either
phenomenon.
At 12,000 to 16,000 feet, small cumulus

flash floods. Some of the more ferocious
storms also spawn tornadoes. Obviously, these
are not conditions suitable for balloon flying.


'lightning strokes, hail, heavy rainfall, and even


It should be noted that there is still much
unknown about just how thunderstorms
operate. For instance, scientists still do not
fully understand what causes lightning and its
close association with rain. Some lightning ·serves as a catalyst in the formation think of
rain while others believe that the rapid descent
of charged rain or hail generates lightning.

municate short term storm details to remote
locations-often the locations where ballooning takes place. By the very nature of the
storm's behavior, one area may be missed
while another may experience high winds and a
torrential downpour. This is why balloonists
must keep a eye for a rapidly darkening western or south-western sky followed by watchful
distant thunder and lightning, as well ~s local
irregular shifts in wind speed and direction.
Such symptoms provide approximately 30
minutes of advance warning. Dust on the
horizon signals the onset of gusty surface
winds of the encroaching storm determined by
observing the direction of the anvil-shaped
cloud blowing out ahead of the system.
Peak gusts of a raging thunderstorm strike
abruptly and leave little time for a safe landing.
Even airplanes have broken up in flight several
miles from a storm, so one can just imagine
what could happen to a relatively frail balloon.
A thunderstorm is said to reach maturity
when rain begins to fall. Since the storm is
essentially vertical the falling rain penetrates
the clouds and its aerodynamic drag creates
downdrafts. Each drop causes more drops to
precipitate and some air is dragged downward.
The result is a mass of downrushing air that
turns at right angles when it reaches the sur·
face and then spreads out away from the col·
umn of heavy precipitation. Most of the
downrushing air turns in the direction of the
overall storm movement, creating a gust front
that could cause a excitement for the unwary balloon pilot. Jot of
Even though thunderheads may be. seen to
be forming in the distance, the balloonists can
easily be tempted to continue flying in gentle

Summertime is also thermal season and it
would be wise for all balloonists to respect the
sun-generated weather phenomenon known as
the thermal. When the lower atmosphere is
heated and the lapse rate air becomes dryadiabatic, the conditions are ideal. of


Surfaces with low solar reflectivity and with
shelter from the wind are the most likely
breeding grounds. Calm conditions promote
thermals by allowing more time for isolated or
sheltered pockets of air to be solar-heated.
Here, more heat energy is provided than the
surface can absorb. The extra heat is trans·
!erred to the air by convection, causing it to
become buoyant. As the bubble of superheated
air rises, it displaces the air above it, forcing it
into an unstable condition. Under these condi·
lions, as thermals form, a balloon's drift may be
abruptly shifted in speed and direction without
a change in altitude or it may begin to trace a
wide curved path. These are the first signs of
thermal activity. Southeast-facing slopes have
greater potential for thermal development than
flat terrain because of the higher sun angles,
thus permitting more solar heating. Thermals,
like balloons, tend to drift with the wind (so one
may ride along with it for a while), but break up
when the wind speed exceeds 15-20 knots.

Like in the case of the thunderstorm, a
balloon can be drawn into the center of a ther·
mal where the action of the vortex can cause
the basket to swing outward beneath the
envelope as the balloon traces a spiraling path
that climbs at an alarming rate, perhaps more
than 1000 fpm. This is false climb since no heat
was added to the envelope by the burners. The
pilot must anticipate a sudden loss of-lift and a
potential downdraft when the balloon pops out
of the thermal. Heat should be applied to offset
a rapid uncontrolled descent. The flatt<;lning
and distorting stresses on the top panel could
cause an inadvertent ripout at high altitude or
the side panels could split open. For this
reason, the first sign of thermal activity should
herald the end of ballooning for that day.
Remember that in the summer mqnths, the
sun rises earlier and heats the ground sooner.
Sun angles are. high therefore the morning
flight hours are reduced, especially when the
air is clear, dry and calm. Fortunately, weak
thermals. precede more powerful thermals. The
unstable conditions during early thermal
development normally warn the pilot of the
pending danger, but only if he is alert to subtle
changes in his balloon's behavior.
