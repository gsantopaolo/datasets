**FOREWORD**


The purpose of this series of publications is to provide the general


may improve aircraft operational safety. Because aviation flying public with information of the increasing that activity in balloon operations and
the increase in accidents involving balloons, safety tips for balloon pilots
will be included in the Accident Prevention Program pamphlet series.
This article, contributed by the Albuquerque Aerostat Ascention
Association, was written by Mr. Robert L. Ruppenthal, former Chief Design
Engineer for Research and Development for Thunder Hot-Air Balloons arid
author of several papers on safety in balloon operations.

BALLOON SAFETY TIPS


Balloons respond to various air currents to a greater degree
than other aircraft. Except for momentary delays wherein iner
tia of the balloon mass resists the energy of a new air current,
the flight path of a balloon in equilibrium exactly mirrors the
direction and velocity of the air current in which it is operating.
This simple fact of balloon operation holds true for horizontal
(the kind we like to fly in), vertical, and rotary air currents (when
Mother Nature flies). This article is about flying with Mother
Nature and includes a few tips on what to do when Mother
Nature's flying becomes -too exciting.

FALSE LIFT


False lift Is an aerodynamic phenomena which occurs dur-

ing the initial acceleration of the balloon. A balloon standing
in the wind acts as an obstacle to normal air flow causing the
the balloon. Changing the wind speed causes a pressure conversion wind speed to increase on the surface of to occur
(static pressure decreases and velocity pressure increases)
which results in false lift. During launch false lift couples with
the balloon's normal lifting forces to cause the balloon to take
off. The problem with having false lift is that it quits when the
balloon reaches wind speed. Ready or not, false lift dissipates
rapidly after takeoff causing the pilot to apply heat constantly
in order to gain real lift before acceleration is complete. In a
practical sense, ·false pose any operating problems until the wind speed exceeds approximately lift does not 10 mph.


False lift is unavoidable in a fast wind making takeoffs a
challenge for the balloon pilot. Simultaneously, the pilot must
watch burner operation, fabric, control the crew, assess the
balloon's physical readiness for flight and judge the lift. The
confusion of burner noise, paSsenger and crew demands, and
the. physical jolting caused by the gondola dragging across
the gro!Jnd can quickly overload an unprepared pilOt. The pilot
should carefully prepare, inspect and rig the balloon prior to
inflation to minimize the tasks required during inflation and
prior to takeoff. This procedure is necessary to insure that the
balloon is safe in the event takeoff occurs unexpectedly. The
pilot must always assume false lift is present during takeoff,
that the envelope lift is inadequate, and continue heating until
balloon acceleration is complete and a positive climb rate is
established. During takeoff and acceleration It is not possible
to differentiate between real lift and false lift. The best policy
is to heat past equilibrluril temperature and then vent as
necessary to maintain a comfortable rate of climb. False lift is
easier to overcome when burner output is high, therefore fuel
pressure Is the best information available to judge the
balloon's ability to overcome false lift . Small burners on big
envelopes are obviously a poor choice of equipment for'fast
wind operation. Obviously the takeoff field is important in fast
wind operations. Obstructions downwind require additional
clearance depending on wind speed due to the reduced initial
climb rate of the balloon after losing the false lift.

Wind shear is a phenomena that resembles. false lift in many
ways. The principle difference is that the·balloon is airborne
and may be accelerating or decelerating. In a practical sense,
there is no difference between acceleration _oi'_ deceleration
since the balloon is symmetrical and responds uniformly to air
floW in any direction. The real difference from a pilot's view
point is the location of the occurrence. False lift occurs from a
known position selected by the pilot. Wind shear locations are
usually unknown to the pilot which can increase the hazard. 1
recall a windy landing which was unfortunately expedited by a
strong decelerating wind shear. At that time my balloon was
not fitted With a skirt. The wind had increased unexpectedly to

internal pressure than a larger envelope. A large envelope, loaded Given an identical load, a small envelope will have a higher
to its rated gross weight, will have a higher internal pressure
than a small envelope loaded to its rated grosS weight
because of its greater height. What does all .thi.s mean to a
pilot? Simply that a lightly loaded balloon will distort more
than a heavily loaded balloon when it encounters a shear or
gust because the internal pressure offers the only resistance
to. those wind forces.
There is a serious hazard to flight associated with wind
shear which could be easily overlooked. A heavy shear gust

40 degrees: in severe turbulence. If the burner is operating at
the moment the envelope displacf;!S, severe structural damage
to the throat can occur. Structural damage is not loss of fabric;
fabric Is not significant In the throat area because there Is no
Internal pressure. Structural damage is loss of load tapes or
ropes. The gravity of this problem is not easily visualized. The
scenario involves the Joss of lift and thus pressure in the
envelope and the loss of two or _mo(e_ load tapes or ropes.
When the load elements are burned free portion of the envelope is no longer supported. the fabric If of the that throat
pressure Is low or negative the fabric repositions Itself Into the
balloon throat thus blocking the burner from the envelope. As
the balloon begins to descend the velocity pressure created bY.
the downward flight of the balloon presses on this unsl'/)
po~ed fabric causing it to close the throat further. At sol


valley and the landing sites were typically small and surrounded
by trees. I decided to descend to tree top eiev~tion so that 1
would be ready when a suitable landing site appeared. 1 wasn't
experienced enough to realize that strong shears are typically
present just above tree lines. The shear destroyed the
balloon's lift and I descended through the trees and into a
occupants or balloon. I learned 3 big lessons small clearing. We hit hard but there was no damage that day. First, to that
velcro tops are not rated for the life of the envelope. Second,
lose control. Third, that skirts are a necessity because they allow you wind shears can deflate the ·balloon sufficiently to
to heat during a shear.
Let's examine what is
happening dynamically and thermodynamically to the envelope in a wind shear. The initial
reaction of the envelope to a wind shear Is to distort and gain
false lift. False lift occurs instantaneously and is momentarily
beneficial. Distortion occurs a little slower and is proportional
to the gross weight of the balloon, envelope volume, and the
strength of the shear. There Is no evidence to suggest that one
envelope design is more resistant to wind shear forces· than
another. The effect of distortion is to reduce the envelope
volume causing exhalation through the throat which Is follow-

clearing it at high altitude. An approximate safe altitude is 3 to
4 thousand feet above highest terrain. Surprisingly, rotor
winds can be completely free of turbulence; however, this is
not always true. Fortunately balloon flight over mountains is
not the typical flight. Those who choose to fly in mountains
should realize that there are serious hazards which can
supersede the sc6nery;.rotors are just one of those hazards.


ROTOR


Rotor Winds are associated with mountainous terrain and
strong winds aloft. Mountain flights should anticipate rotor
winds, and in particular, when wind aloft forecasts exceed 15

-  knots at mountain peak altitude. Prediction of rotor winds is
not a well developed science. Typically a rotor wind will have
forces which exceed the performance of the balloon.
Downward airflow will therefore carry the balloon to the
ground even with the envelope at red line temperature. Further,
it is difficult to escape from a rotor. The only apparent escape
