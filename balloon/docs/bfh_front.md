### Preface

This Balloon Flying Handbook introduces the basic pilot knowledge and skills that are essential for piloting balloons.
It introduces pilots to the broad spectrum of knowledge that will be needed as they progress in their pilot training. This
handbook is for student pilots, as well as those pursuing more advanced pilot certificates.

Student pilots learning to fly balloons, certificated pilots preparing for additional balloon ratings or who desire to improve
their flying proficiency and aeronautical knowledge, and commercial balloon pilots teaching balloon students how to fly
should find this handbook helpful. This book introduces the prospective pilot to the realm of balloon flight and provides
information and guidance to all balloon pilots in the performance of various balloon maneuvers and procedures.

This handbook conforms to pilot training and certification concepts established by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA). There are different ways of teaching, as well as performing flight procedures and maneuvers, and many variations
in the explanations of aerodynamic theories and principles. This handbook adopts a selective method and concept to
flying balloons. The discussions and explanations reflect the most commonly used practices and principles. Occasionally,
the word “must” or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not
intended to add to, interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).

It is essential for persons using this handbook also to become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of 14 CFR and
the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). Performance standards for demonstrating competence required for pilot
certification are prescribed in the appropriate balloon practical test standard.

This handbook supersedes FAA-H-8083-11A, Balloon Flying Handbook, dated 2008.

This handbook is available for download, in PDF format, from the [FAA website](http://www.faa.gov) .

This handbook is published by the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, General
Aviation & Commercial Division, Training & Certification Group (AFS-810), Testing Standards Section, P.O. Box 25082,
