# Chapter 5: The National Airspace System

**Introduction**

19443
The National Airspace System (NAS) is the network of all components regarding airspace in the United States. This
comprehensive label includes air navigation facilities, equipment, services, airports or landing areas, aeronautical charts,
information/services, rules, regulations, procedures, technical information, manpower, and material. Many of these system
components are shared jointly with the military. To conform to international aviation standards, the United States adopted
the primary elements of the classification system developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This
chapter provides a general discussion of airspace classification. Detailed information on the classification of airspace,
operating procedures, and restrictions is found in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM)

19444
This handbook departs from the conventional norm, in that the airspace discussions are presented in reverse order, in
the belief that it is much easier to learn the airspace from least complicated to most complicated; also, the information
presented for basic visual flight rules (VFR) weather minimums is only that necessary for balloon operations. [ _Figure 5-1_ ]
Other information, specifically for instrument flight rules (IFR) flying or night flight, has been omitted, as it has little
or no value to the balloon pilot. For a complete discussion of these issues, the balloon pilot should refer to the AIM, or
FAA-H-8083-25, Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge.

**Airspace Classification**

19446
The two categories of airspace are regulatory and non-regulatory. Within these two categories, there are four types:
uncontrolled, controlled, special use, and other airspace. _Figure 5-2_ presents a profile view of the dimensions of various
classes of airspace. It will be helpful to refer to this figure as this chapter is studied, as well as remembering that almost all
sport balloon operations are conducted in Class E or G airspace.

**Uncontrolled Airspace**

19448
The following are kinds of uncontrolled airspace.

**_Class G Airspace_**

19449
Class G or uncontrolled airspace is the portion of the airspace that has not been designated as Class A, B, C, D, or E. Class
G airspace extends from the surface to the base of the overlying Class E airspace. Although air traffic control (ATC) has no
authority or responsibility to control air traffic within Class G airspace, pilots should remember there are VFR minimums
which apply while operating in it. Class G airspace is essentially uncontrolled by ATC except when associated with a
temporary control tower. [ _Figure 5-2_ and _Figure 5-3_ ]

19450

**Class G**


**Minimum Pilot Qualifications**
**VFR Visibility Minimum**
**VFR Minimum Distance from Clouds**


Student certificate
1 statute mile
Clear of clouds


**Figure 5-3.** _Class G airspace_

19451
In the eastern half of the United States, most Class G airspace is overlaid with Class E airspace, beginning at either 700
or 1,200 feet above ground level (AGL). In the western half of the United States, much of the Class G airspace goes up to
14,500 feet before the Class E airspace begins. The pilot is advised to consult the appropriate sectional chart to ensure that
they are aware of the airspace limits prior to flight in an unfamiliar area.


-----

Most balloon operations are conducted in Class G airspace. There are no communications requirements to operate in Class
G airspace. If operations are conducted at an altitude of 1,200 feet or less AGL, the pilot must remain clear of clouds, and
there must be one statute mile of visibility. If the operations are conducted more than 1,200 feet AGL, but less than 10,000
feet mean sea level (MSL), visibility requirements remain at one statute mile, but cloud clearances are 1,000 feet above,
500 feet below, and 2,000 feet horizontally from any cloud(s). A popular mnemonic tool used to remember basic cloud
clearances is “C152,” a popular fixed-wing training aircraft. In this case, the mnemonic recalls, “Clouds 1,000, 500, and
2,000.”

**Controlled Airspace**

19453
Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers the different classifications of airspace and defined dimensions within
which ATC service is provided in accordance with the airspace classification. Controlled airspace consists of:

18713

-  Class E.

18712

-  Class D.

18711

-  Class C.

18710

-  Class B.

9734

-  Class A.

**_Class E Airspace_**

19459
Generally, if the airspace is not Class A, B, C, or D, and is controlled airspace, then it is Class E airspace. Class E airspace
extends upward from either the surface or a designated altitude to the overlying or adjacent controlled airspace. [ _Figure 5-2_
and _Figure 5-4_ ] Also in this class are federal airways and airspace beginning at either 700 or 1,200 feet AGL used to
transition to and from the terminal or en route environment. Unless designated at a lower altitude, Class E airspace begins
at 14,500 MSL over the United States, including that airspace overlying the waters within 12 nautical miles (NM) of the
coast of the 48 contiguous states and Alaska, up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL, and the airspace above FL 600.

19460

**Class E**


**Minimum Pilot Qualifications**
**VFR Visibility Minimum**
**VFR Minimum Distance from Clouds**


Student certificate
3 statute miles
500' below, 1,000' above,
2,000' horizontal


**Figure 5-4.** _Class E airspace._

19461
There are no specific communications requirements associated with Class E airspace; however, some Class E airspace
locations are designed to provide approaches for instrument approaches, and a pilot would be prudent to ensure that
appropriate communications are established when operating near those areas.

19462
Visibility and cloud clearances for operations conducted in Class E airspace are similar to those of the Class G airspace. If
balloon operations are being conducted below 10,000 feet MSL, visibility is three statute miles and the basic VFR cloud
clearance requirements of 1,000 feet above, 500 feet below, and 2,000 feet horizontal (remember the C152 mnemonic).
Operations above 10,000 feet MSL require visibility of five statute miles and cloud clearance of 1,000 feet above, 1,000
feet below, and one statute mile horizontally.


-----

**_Class D Airspace_**

19463
Class D is that airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet AGL (but charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an
operational control tower. [ _Figure 5-2_ and _Figure 5-5_ ] The configuration of each Class D airspace area is individually
tailored. When instrument procedures are published, the airspace is normally designed to contain the procedures.

19464

**Class D**


**Entry Requirements**
**Minimum Pilot Qualifications**
**Two-Way Radio Communications**
**VFR Visibility Minimum**
**VFR Minimum Distance from Clouds**

Student certificate
Yes
3 statute miles
500' below,1,000' above,
2,000' horizontal


**Figure 5-5.** _Class D airspace_

19465
Unless otherwise authorized, each aircraft must establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing
air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while in the airspace.
Balloon pilots approaching Class D airspace should call the ATC facility at a point where, if entry is denied, a safe
landing can still be executed. It is important to understand that if the controller responds to the initial radio call without
using the balloon’s call sign, radio communications have not been established, and the balloon may not enter the Class D
airspace. Many airports associated with Class D airspace do not operate on a 24-hour-a-day basis. When not in operation,
the airspace will normally revert to Class E or G airspace, with no communications requirements. In either case, balloon
pilots are reminded that, in the absence of an emergency situation, there is no absolute requirement to land at the airport
associated with the Class D airspace. In most cases, the first radio call will be made at a distance of five statute miles from
the airport.

19466
Balloon pilots operating in the vicinity of an airport should exercise discretion. While balloons indeed have the right of
way over all powered aircraft as stated in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91, section 91.113,
a pilot would cause less disruption by landing well short of the airport. This is nothing more than common courtesy and
common sense. The visibility requirement for Class D airspace is three statute miles; cloud clearances are the standard
VFR 1,000/500/2,000.

**_Class C Airspace_**

19467
Class C airspace normally extends from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation surrounding those airports
having an operational control tower, that are serviced by a radar approach control, and with a certain number of IFR or
passenger operations. [ _Figure 5-2_ and _Figure 5-6_ ] This airspace is charted in feet MSL, and is generally of a five NM
radius surface area that extends from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation, and a 10 NM radius area that
extends from 1,200 feet to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation. There is also a noncharted outer area with a 20 NM radius,
which extends from the surface to 4,000 feet above the primary airport, and this area may include one or more satellite
airports. [ _Figure 5-7_ ]

19468

**Figure 5-6.** _Class C airspace._


-----

**Figure 5-7.** _Example of Class C airspace on a sectional._

19470
Balloon operations in Class C airspace, while technically feasible, are usually not advisable. To fly an aircraft in Class C
airspace requires not only a two-way radio to establish and maintain contact with ATC, but also an encoding transponder.
Very few balloons carry a transponder in normal operations. As a practical matter, under certain circumstances and with
prior coordination, it is possible to enter or depart Class C airspace without an operational transponder, but the practice is
generally discouraged. It is possible to fly in the vicinity of a Class C airport; for example, under the lower lateral limits of
the outer layer, without needing to penetrate the inner circle. Again, a balloon pilot is well advised to remain clear of the
controlled airspace, as a matter of common courtesy and good public relations.

19471
Cloud clearances in Class C airspace are the same as Class D airspace: visibility of three statute miles and a distance from
clouds of 1,000/500/2,000.

**_Class B Airspace_**

19472
Class B airspace is generally airspace from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL surrounding the nation’s busiest airports in
terms of airport operations. [ _Figure 5-2_ and _Figure 5-8_ ] The configuration of each Class B airspace area is individually
tailored, consists of a surface area and two or more layers (some Class B airspace areas resemble upside-down wedding
cakes). An ATC clearance is required for all aircraft to operate in the area, and all aircraft that are so cleared receive
separation services within the airspace.

19473

**Figure 5-8.** _Class B airspace._


-----

As a general rule, balloons do not freely operate within Class B airspace. Equipment requirements are the same as for
Class C airspace; however, due to air traffic congestion, the balloon pilot requesting entry to Class B airspace will likely
be denied entry, as ballooning operations inside the Class B airspace constitute a potential traffic conflict. Most traffic
transiting the Class B airspace is being flown under an IFR flight plan, or, in the very least, provide a radar signature which
allows ATC to provide traffic separation. Due to their construction, balloons do not provide a radar return much larger than
a small flock of birds (and are frequently mistaken as such).

19475
Should it become necessary for operational reasons to fly through Class B airspace, that flight should be coordinated at
least one hour prior, as provided for by 14 CFR section 91.215. It is permissible, and perfectly legal, to operate a balloon
under the lateral limits of the Class B airspace. Balloon pilots operating in the vicinity of Class B airspace are encouraged
to be familiar with the airspace, including visual ground reference points when conducting flight under the lateral limits to
avoid inadvertently encroaching on Class B airspace. Since aircraft operating in Class B airspace are under radar control,
there is a slight difference in the cloud clearance requirements. Visibility remains three statute miles, but the only cloud
clearance requirement is that the pilot remain clear of clouds.

**_Class A Airspace_**

19476
Class A airspace is generally the airspace from 18,000 feet MSL up to and including FL 600, including the airspace
overlying the waters within 12 NM of the coast of the 48 contiguous states and Alaska. Unless otherwise authorized, all
operations in Class A airspace are conducted under IFR. For that reason, balloons do not utilize the Class A airspace, unless
operated on a waiver or are conducting some special operation, such as a record attempt.

**Special Use Airspace**

19477
Special Use Airspace (or Special Area of Operation) is the designation for airspace in which certain activities must be
confined, or where limitations may be imposed on aircraft operations that are not part of those activities. Certain special
use airspace areas can create limitations on the mixed use of airspace. The special use airspace depicted on sectional charts
includes the area name or number, effective altitude, time and weather conditions of operation, the controlling agency, and
the chart panel location. On National Aeronautical Charting Group (NACG) sectional charts, this information is available
on one of the end panels.

19478
Special use airspace usually consists of:

9746

-  Prohibited areas.

18714

-  Restricted areas.

18715

-  Warning areas.

18716

-  Military operation areas (MOAs).

18717

-  Alert areas.

19484

-  Controlled firing areas.

**_Prohibited Areas_**

9747
Prohibited areas define airspace where the flight of civil aircraft cannot occur. Such areas exist for security or the national
welfare. Aeronautical charts show these areas with a “P” followed by a number (e.g., P-40).

33482
Examples of prohibited areas could include Camp David and the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where the White
House and the Congressional buildings are located. [ _Figure 5-9_ ]


-----

**Figure 5-9.** _An example of a prohibited area is Crawford, Texas._

**_Restricted Areas_**

6589
Restricted areas contain activity hazardous to nonparticipating aircraft, and these areas may impose restrictions upon
aircraft operations not a part of the activity. Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, often invisible, hazards to
aircraft (e.g., artillery firing, aerial gunnery, or guided missiles). Penetration of an active restricted area should not occur
without authorization from the controlling agency.

33486
ATC facilities apply the following procedures:

19488

1. If the restricted area is not active and has been released to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the ATC
facility will allow the aircraft to operate in the restricted airspace without issuing specific clearance for it to do so.

19489

2. If the restricted area is active and has not been released to the FAA, the ATC facility will issue a clearance which
will ensure the aircraft avoids the restricted airspace.

19490
Restricted areas are charted with an “R” followed by a number (e.g., “R-4401”) and are depicted on the sectional charts.

[ _Figure 5-10_ ] Restricted area information can be obtained on the back of the chart. [ _Figure 5-11_ ]

19491

**Figure 5-10.** _Restricted areas on a sectional chart_


-----

**Figure 5-11.** _Specific information about a restricted area can be found on the back of the sectional chart._

**_Warning Areas_**

19493
Warning areas consist of airspace which may contain hazards to nonparticipating aircraft in international airspace. The
activities may be much the same as those for a restricted area. Warning areas are established beyond the three mile limit
and are depicted on aeronautical charts. Warning Areas are also defined on the backside of the appropriate sectional chart.

[ _Figure 5-11_ ]

**_Military Operation Areas_**

19494
Military operation areas (MOA) consist of airspace of defined vertical and lateral limits established for the purpose of
separating certain military training activity from IFR traffic. There is no restriction against a pilot operating VFR in these
areas; however, a pilot should be alert since training activities may include acrobatic and abrupt maneuvers. MOAs are
depicted by name and with defined boundaries on sectional, VFR terminal area, and en route low altitude charts and are
not numbered (e.g., “Camden Ridge MOA”). [ _Figure 5-12_ ] However, the MOA is also further defined on the back of the
sectional chart with times of operation, altitudes affected, and the controlling agency. [ _Figure 5-13_ ]


-----

**Figure 5-12.** _Camden Ridge MOA is an example of a military operations area._

19496

**Figure 5-13.** _Additional information found on the sectional chart for Camden Ridge MOA._

**_Alert Areas_**

19497
Alert areas are depicted on aeronautical charts with an “A” followed by a number (e.g., “A-211”) to inform nonparticipating
pilots of areas that may contain a high volume of pilot training or an unusual type of aerial activity. Pilots should exercise
caution in alert areas. All activity within an alert area shall be conducted in accordance with regulations, without waiver,
and pilots of participating aircraft, as well as pilots transiting the area, shall be equally responsible for collision avoidance.

[ _Figure 5-14_ ]

19498

**Figure 5-14.** _Alert area (A-211)._


-----

**_Controlled Firing Areas_**

19499
Controlled firing areas contain military activities, which, if not conducted in a controlled environment, could be hazardous
to nonparticipating aircraft. The difference between controlled firing areas and other special use airspace is that activities
must be suspended when a spotter aircraft, radar, or ground lookout position indicates an aircraft might be approaching
the area.

**Other Airspace Areas**

9755
“Other airspace areas” is a general term referring to the majority of the remaining airspace. It includes:

19501

-  Airport advisory areas.

19502

-  Military training routes (MTR).

19503

-  Temporary flight restrictions (TFR).

19504

-  National security areas.

**_Airport Advisory Areas_**

19505
An airport advisory area is an area within 10 statute miles (SM) of an airport where a control tower is not operating,
but where a flight service station (FSS) is located. At these locations, the FSS provides advisory service to arriving and
departing aircraft.

19507
MTR are usually indicated with a blue line on the sectional chart. A balloon pilot flying in the area of numerous VRs or IRs
should question the briefer during the weather brief to find out if any of the routes are in use, and a possible time frame for
opening and closing. While it is true that the balloon pilot has the right of way, the balloon will generally come out worse in
a midair conflict with a fast-moving military aircraft. MTRs, such as the example depicted in _Figure 5-15_ , are also further
defined on the back of the sectional charts.

19508

**Figure 5-15.** _Military training routes (MTR) chart symbols._

**Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR)**

6596
Temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) go into effect when traffic in the airspace would endanger or hamper air or ground
activities in the area. For example, a forest fire, chemical accident, flood, or disaster-relief effort could warrant a TFR, which
would issue as a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM). The NOTAM begins with the phrase “FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS”


-----

followed by the location of the temporary restriction, effective time, area defined in statute miles, and altitudes affected.
The NOTAM also contains the FAA coordination facility and telephone number, the reason for the restriction, and any
other information deemed appropriate. The pilot should check for NOTAMs during flight planning.

19510
The reasons for establishing a temporary restriction are:

9761

-  Protect persons and property in the air or on the surface from an existing or imminent hazard.

18733

-  Provide a safe environment for the operation of disaster relief aircraft.

19513

-  Prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft above an incident or event, which may generate a high degree

of public interest.

19514

-  Protect declared national disasters for humanitarian reasons.

19515

-  Protect the President, Vice President, or other public figures.

19516

-  Provide a safe environment for space agency operations.

19517
Since the events of September 11, the use of TFRs has become much more common. There have been a number of
incidents of aircraft incursions into TFRs, which have resulted in pilots undergoing security investigations, and certificate
suspensions. It is a pilot’s responsibility to be aware of TFRs in their proposed area of flight. [ _Figure 5-16_ ] One way to
check is to visit the [FAA’s TFR website](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/temporary_flight_restrictions) , and verify that there is not a TFR in the area.


-----

**Figure 5-16.** _A temporary flight restriction (TFR) imposed at Boston’s Logan Airport to general aviation and restricting operations at_

_surrounding airports._

19519
Another TFR issue that the balloon pilot needs to be aware of are the restrictions imposed under 14 CFR part 91, section
91.145. In this regulation, the FAA has codified restrictions against the overflight of major outdoor events, such as the


-----

World Series, the Rose Bowl, and NASCAR events. Several years ago, it was relatively common to see hot air balloons
promoting products or services being flown over these events, providing exposure for the commercial sponsor. Now, there
are significant distance and altitude restrictions for such events, and any operations inside the TFR area must be conducted
under the provisions of a waiver. Should such an operation be contemplated, the balloon pilot should consult with the local
Flight Service District Office (FSDO) well in advance of the event.

**_National Security Areas_**

9767
National Security Areas (NSA) consist of airspace of defined vertical and lateral dimensions established at locations with
a requirement for increased security and safety of ground facilities. Pilots should voluntarily avoid flying through any
depicted NSA. When necessary to provide a greater level of security and safety, the FAA may temporarily prohibit flight
in NSAs by regulation under the provisions of 14 CFR part 99, section 99.7.

**Radio Communications**

19521
When utilizing the NAS, there are many occasions when it is necessary to communicate with a control tower, a controlling
agency, or another aircraft. Balloon pilots should have a working knowledge of correct radio procedures in order to
properly exercise their privileges, and not interfere with other aviation traffic.

19522
Aviation very-high-frequency (VHF) radios may be used for communications between the balloon pilot and towers, pilot
to FSS, air to air (pilot to pilot), air to ground in some circumstances, and to get information from weather facilities and
automated stations. VHF radios are not to be used as a “telephone service” or in a Citizen’s Band-type of operation; this use
is specifically prohibited by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and may result in monetary fines.

19523
There is no license requirement for a pilot operating in the United States; however, a pilot who may be operating outside
the country is required to hold a restricted radiotelephone permit issued by the FCC. There is also no station license
requirement for a handheld radio used in a balloon, as it is not permanently mounted. A station license may be required
when a balloon is operated outside the country; it is best to check with the appropriate local authorities before contemplating
such an operation.

19524
The single most important aspect of radio communication is clarity. Keeping one’s transmissions brief, and using correct
terminology and phraseology when operating an aircraft radio is imperative. All frequencies are shared with others; a
pilot’s idle chatter to a chase crew could inadvertently block another pilot’s emergency transmission at an airfield many
miles away. A good pilot will minimize radio requirements, and think before speaking.

**Phonetic Alphabet**

19525
The ICAO, of which the United States is a member, has adopted a phonetic alphabet, which should be used in radio
communications as necessary. When communicating with air traffic control facilities, pilots should use this alphabet to
identify their aircraft. [ _Figure 5-17_ ]

**Radio Procedures**

19527
The Pilot/Controller Glossary (found in the AIM) contains correct language for communications between a pilot at ATC
facilities. Good phraseology enhances safety and is the mark of a conscientious pilot. Jargon, slang, and “CB” codes should
not be used in radio communications.


-----

A pilot should listen to the radio before transmitting. Do not clutter the frequency with inappropriate requests or irrelevant
information. Most pilots will think before keying their radio, and keep the transmission as brief as possible. The pilot
should be occupied with control of the balloon and should not be spending time on the radio.

**_When Departing a Non-towered Airport_**

19529
A balloon pilot departing a non-towered airport should make a call on the field’s UNICOM or CTAF (Common Traffic
Advisory Frequency), both of which are generally shown on the appropriate sectional chart. The pilot should state their
location and intentions, as a “self-announce” advisory, so that other air traffic in the area is aware of the operation.

19530
Example: “Williamson traffic, balloon 3584 Golf departing the grass near hanger 12 to the east.”

**_When Approaching a Non-towered Airport_**

19531
If an approach to a non-towered airport is conducted, with the intent to land, the pilot should again “self-announce” on the
appropriate UNICOM frequency or CTAF. The current location should be stated, as well as the pilot’s intentions.

19532
Example: “Air Acres traffic, balloon 3584 Golf approaching from the west for landing at the departure end of the runway.”

**_When Transiting a Non-towered Facility_**

19533
If flight in the vicinity of a non-towered airport is likely, with no intent to land at the airfield, it is appropriate to let other
aircraft in the area know the intentions, particularly if there is the possibility of interfering with the traffic pattern.

19534
Example: “Enterprise traffic, balloon 7510 Delta at 700 feet, transiting from east to west along the north boundary of the
field, no landing.”

**_When Approaching Controlled Airspace_**

19535
When approaching controlled airspace, and it appears that entry into the airspace is likely (or desired), the balloon pilot
should contact the appropriate approach control with enough time to execute a landing, should entry be denied. Remember
that a balloon usually does not have the option of turning around.

19536
**_Example:_** “Huntsville Approach, balloon 903 Hotel Delta, at 3,000.”

19537
The approach control facility (in this example, Huntsville Approach) will either reply by saying, “Aircraft calling Huntsville
Approach, standby”, in which case the balloon pilot does not have a clearance to enter the airspace; or, approach will reply,
saying “Balloon 903 Hotel Delta, Huntsville, standby.” In this case, the aircraft call sign was used, and the pilot may enter
the airspace. Further communication may continue until the balloon has either landed or cleared the airspace.

19538
In the event that radio communication has failed, or that no radio is available in the balloon, and continued flight into
the immediate vicinity of an towered airport facility cannot be avoided, control towers have a “light gun” available.
This device, which looks like an oversized flare gun, allows tower personnel to “shoot” a directed beam of light at an
approaching aircraft, and may signal field availability options to the approaching balloon. [ _Figure 5-18_ ]

Many balloon pilots fly for years without using a radio of any kind. Using an aircraft radio is not a difficult task, and, with
practice, can provide a more enjoyable flight. Most ATCs express an interest in balloons, and go out of their way to assist
balloon pilots in accomplishing their flight safely.

**Chapter Summary**

19541
At first glance, the NAS appears to be a complex arena in which to operate such a simple aircraft. This chapter simplifies
the airspace to the reader, and makes it readily apparent that it is possible to operate a hot air balloon safely, without causing
conflict.

19542
Simple courtesy and common sense goes a long way in airspace operations. A complete and thorough understanding of the
airspace, combined with good decision-making, will allow the pilot to do what they wish, with recognition of the needs of
other users of the sky.
