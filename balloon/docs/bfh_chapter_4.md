# Chapter 4: Weather Theory & Reports

**Introduction**

18990
Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place, with respect to temperature, moisture content, stability,
visibility, and cloudiness. These factors interact to form the following five major meteorological elements:

18991

-  Atmospheric pressure (high or low).

18992

-  Wind (calm or storm).

18993

-  Clouds (clearness or cloudiness).

18994

-  Precipitation (rain, sleet, snow).

18995
A solid understanding of weather theory provides the tools necessary to understand the reports and forecasts obtained from
a Flight Service Station (FSS) weather specialist and other aviation weather services. No other means of aviation relies
more heavily on knowledge and understanding of weather for its safety than ballooning. It is important to note, however,
that there is no substitute for experience.

18996
There are many excellent texts and online sources available for learning more about weather that are referenced at the
appropriate point in this chapter. Much of the following information can be found in the Aviation Weather Handbook
FAA-H-8083-28, which may be found on the [FAA’s website](http://www.faa.gov) .

18998
Other online sources for weather information are also helpful. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) offers a [weather tutorial](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/wct/tutorials/) . Developed to meet the needs of educators, weather professionals, and others interested
in learning more about weather, it provides a number of concise explanations of weather theory. Additionally, there is a
site developed as part of the Weather World 2010 project by the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of](http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/home.rxml)
[Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/home.rxml) .

This chapter is designed to give balloon pilots a basic knowledge of weather principles, acquaint them with the weather
information available for flight planning, and help them develop sound decision-making skills as they prepare for and
execute a safe flight.

**The Atmosphere**

19002
The atmosphere is the envelope of air that surrounds the Earth. Approximately one-half of the air, by weight, is within the
lower 18,000 feet. The remainder of the air is spread over a vertical distance in excess of 1,000 miles. No definite outer
atmospheric boundary exists, but the air particles become less numerous with increasing altitude until they gradually
overcome Earth’s gravity and escape into space. In addition to the rotation of the air with the rotation of the Earth, another
type of air movement occurs within the atmosphere. This movement of air around the surface of the Earth is called
atmospheric circulation.

**Composition**

19003
The atmosphere is a blanket of air composed of a mixture of gases that surrounds the Earth and reaches over 560 kilometers
(km), 348 miles, from the surface. This blanket of gases provides protection from ultraviolet rays, as well as supporting
human, animal, and plant life. Nitrogen accounts for 78 percent of the gases comprising the atmosphere, while oxygen
makes up 21 percent. [ _Figure 4-1_ ] Argon, carbon dioxide, and traces of other gases make up the remaining 1 percent.
Within this envelope of gases, there are several recognizable layers of the atmosphere as defined by altitude.

**Nitrogen** **Oxygen** **Trace gases**

**Figure 4-1.** _Composition of the atmosphere._

19005
The first layer, closest layer to the surface, known as the troposphere, extends from sea level up to 20,000 feet (8 km) over
the northern and southern poles and up to 48,000 feet (14.5 km) over the equatorial regions. The vast majority of weather,
clouds, storms, and temperature variances occur within this first layer of the atmosphere.

**The Standard Atmosphere**

19006
To provide a common reference when discussing weather, the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) has been
established. To arrive at the standard atmosphere, conditions throughout the atmosphere with respect to latitudes, seasons,
and altitudes were averaged. The standard reference point is 59 °F or 15 °C, and 29.92 inches of mercury ("Hg) or 1013.2
millibars (mb). Pressure does not decrease linearly with altitude, but for the first 10,000 feet, 1 "Hg for each 1,000 feet
approximates the rate of pressure change. There is also a standard temperature lapse rate of 3.5 °F or 2 °C per 1,000 feet
of altitude, up to 36,000 feet.

19007
At sea level, the atmosphere exerts pressure on the Earth at a force of 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). This means a
column of air one inch square, extending from the surface up to the upper atmospheric limit, weighs about 14.7 pounds.

19008
A person standing at sea level also experiences the pressure of the atmosphere, but the pressure is a force of pressure over
the entire surface of the skin. The actual pressure at a given place and time will differ with altitude, temperature, and density
of the air. These conditions also affect balloon performance, especially with regard to useful load and burner performance.

**Measurement of Atmospheric Pressure**

19009
Measurement of Atmospheric Pressure Constant pressure charts and hurricane pressure reports are written using millibars
(mb). Since weather stations are located around the globe, all local barometric pressure readings are converted to a sea
level pressure to provide a standard for records and reports. To achieve this, each station converts its barometric pressure
by adding approximately 1 "Hg for every 1,000 feet of elevation gain. For example, a station at 5,000 feet above sea
level, with a reading of 24.92 "Hg, reports a sea level pressure reading of 29.92 "Hg. Using common sea level pressure
readings helps ensure aircraft altimeters are set correctly, based on the current pressure readings. In order to compensate
for pressure variations due to different station elevations, all observations are mathematically corrected to mean sea level
(MSL). Altimeter settings are obtained by mathematically reducing station pressure to MSL. This enables the pilot to read
MSL altitudes on the altimeter.

19010
When charting atmospheric pressures over various areas of the Earth, the meteorologist is primarily interested in the
pressure difference per unit of horizontal distance—the pressure gradient.

19011
The MSL pressure is plotted in mb at each reporting station on a surface weather map. The isobars outline pressure areas
in somewhat the same manner that contour lines outline terrain features on contour maps. The standard procedure on


-----

surface weather maps in North America is to draw isobars at four mb intervals, with intermediate, two mb spacing when
appropriate. Although the isobar patterns are never the same on any two weather maps, they do show patterns of similarity.

10038
By tracking barometric pressure trends across a large area, weather forecasters can more accurately predict movement
of pressure systems and the associated weather. For example, tracking a pattern of rising pressure at a single weather
station generally indicates the approach of fair weather. Conversely, decreasing or rapidly falling pressure usually indicates
approaching bad weather and possible severe storms.

**Temperature**

19013
Temperature is a measurement of the amount of heat and expresses a degree of molecular activity. Since different substances
have different molecular structures, equal amounts of heat applied to equal volumes of two different substances will result
in unequal heating. Every substance has its own unique specific heat. For example, a land surface becomes hotter than
a water surface when equal amounts of heat are added to each. The degree of “hotness” or “coldness” of a substance is
known as its temperature, and is measured with a thermometer.

19014
The Earth’s surface is heated during the day by the sun. This incoming solar radiation is called insolation, while heat
radiated from the Earth by outgoing radiation is called terrestrial radiation. The cooling that occurs at night is terrestrial
radiation.

**Temperature Scales**

19015
Two temperature scales are important to the balloon pilot: Fahrenheit (F) and Celsius (C). On the Fahrenheit scale, the
freezing point is 32° and the boiling point is 212°, a difference of 180°. On the Celsius scale, the freezing point is 0°
and the boiling point is 100°. For many years, the Celsius scale was the choice for technicians and those countries and
organizations utilizing the metric system. In recent years, the United States has transitioned to almost exclusive use of the
Celsius scale in weather reports, primarily because of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) convention
agreements. [ _Figure 4-2_ ]

19017
A quick and easy way to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius is to subtract 30, and divide the number by two. To convert
Celsius to Fahrenheit, double the number, and add 30. These formulas give a good approximation for most calculations in
ballooning. Conversion charts are also available on the Internet.

**Temperature Variations**

19018
The amount of solar radiation (insolation) received by any region varies with the time of day, with seasons, and with
latitude. These differences in insolation and changes in temperature of various air masses create temperature variations.
Temperatures also vary with differences in topographical surface and with altitude. These temperature variations create
forces that drive the atmosphere in its motion. Simply stated, heat and, therefore, temperature differences cause weather.

19019
Diurnal variation is the change in temperature from day to night brought about by the daily rotation of the Earth. The
Earth receives heat during the day by insolation, but continually loses heat by terrestrial radiation. Warming and cooling
depend on an imbalance of insolation and terrestrial radiation. During the day, insolation exceeds terrestrial radiation
and the surface becomes warmer. At night, insolation ceases, but terrestrial radiation continues and cools the surface.
Cooling continues after sunrise until insolation again exceeds terrestrial radiation. Minimum temperature usually occurs
after sunrise, sometimes as much as one hour after. The continued cooling after sunrise is one reason that fog sometimes
forms shortly after the sun is above the horizon.

**_Temperature Variations with Topography_**

19020
Temperature variations are also induced by water and terrain. Water absorbs and radiates heat energy with less temperature
change than does land. Large, deep water bodies tend to minimize temperature changes, while large land masses induce
major temperature changes. Wet soil, such as that found in swamps and marshes, is almost as effective as water in
suppressing temperature changes. Thick vegetation tends to control temperature changes since it contains some water and
also insulates against heat transfer between the ground and the atmosphere. Arid, barren surfaces generate the greatest
temperature changes.

19021
These topographical influences are both diurnal and seasonal. For example, the difference between a daily maximum and
minimum may be 10° or less over water, near a shore line, or over a swamp or marsh, while a difference of 50° or more is
common over rocky or sandy deserts.

19022
Abrupt temperature differences develop along lake and ocean shores. These variations generate pressure differences and
local air flows or winds, which may become a consideration in the balloon pilot’s study of the air mass

19023
Prevailing wind is also a factor in temperature control. In an area where prevailing winds are from large water bodies,
temperature changes are rather small. Most islands enjoy fairly constant temperatures. On the other hand, temperature
changes are more pronounced where prevailing wind is from dry, barren regions.

**_Temperature Variation with Altitude_**

19024
Temperature normally decreases with increasing altitude throughout the troposphere. This decrease of temperature with
altitude is defined as lapse rate. The standard lapse rate seldom exists. In fact, temperature sometimes increases with
height. An increase in temperature with altitude is defined as an inversion.

19025
An inversion often develops near the ground on clear, cool nights when wind is light. The ground radiates and cools much
faster than the overlying air. Air in contact with the ground becomes cold, while the temperature a few hundred feet above
changes very little. Thus, temperature increases with height. Inversions may also occur at any altitude when conditions
are favorable. For example, a current of warm air aloft overrunning cold air near the surface produces an inversion aloft.

19026
Low level inversions, which are usually of most interest to the balloon pilot, generally dissipate through the daylight hours
as the air mixes with insolation.

**Heat Transfer**

19027
The heat source for this planet is the sun; energy from the sun is transferred through space and the Earth’s atmosphere to
the Earth’s surface. As this energy warms the Earth’s surface and atmosphere, some of it is or becomes heat energy. Heat
is transferred into the atmosphere in three ways: radiation, conduction, and convection.


-----

**_Radiation_**

19028
Radiation is the transfer of heat by electromagnetic waves. No medium of transfer is required between the radiator and the
body being irradiated (receiving the radiation). Heat waves, a form of this electromagnetic energy, may be reflected. In
meteorology, the principal reflectors are the Earth’s surface, water vapor in the air, and particulate matter in the atmosphere.

**_Conduction_**

19029
Conduction is the transfer of heat energy from one substance to another or within a substance. As with electricity, some
materials are good conductors while others are poor conductors. Poor conductors are considered to be insulators. Air is
one of the poorest conductors of heat in comparison to silver, one of the best conductors. Silver will pass 20,000 times
more heat than an equal mass of air across a similar temperature difference during a fixed period of time. Conduction in
the atmosphere is considered to be a significant method of heat exchange only at the Earth’s surface, where the lowest few
centimeters of the atmosphere are actually in contact with the ground or water.

**_Convection_**

19030
Convection is the transfer of heat energy in a fluid. This type of heating is most commonly seen in the kitchen when a liquid
boils. This type of heat transfer occurs in the atmosphere when the ground is heated by the sun. The warm ground heats
the air above it by radiation and conduction, causing the warm air to rise. Meanwhile, the dense cooler air aloft moves in
to take the warm ground air’s place to be heated.

19031
Heat can be transferred by convection in either a vertical or a horizontal direction. In meteorology, “advection” is the term
used for the horizontal transport of heat by wind. It is important to differentiate between the vertical and horizontal paths
of convection. In the atmosphere, the amount of heat transferred horizontally over the surface of the Earth by advection is
about 1,000 times greater than that transferred by convection.

**_The Adiabatic Process_**

19032
The adiabatic process is the change of the temperature of air without transferring heat. In an adiabatic process, compression
results in warming, and expansion results in cooling. The adiabatic process takes place in all upward and downward
moving air. When air rises into an area of lower pressure, it expands to a larger volume. As the molecules of air expand, the
temperature of the air lowers. As a result, when a parcel of air rises, pressure decreases, volume increases, and temperature
decreases. When air descends, the opposite is true.

19033
Since air is composed of a mixture of gases subject to heating when compressed and cooling when expanded, air will rise,
seeking a level where the pressure of the body of air is equal to the pressure of the air that surrounds it. Whatever the cause
of the lifting, the air rises, and the pressure decreases, allowing the “parcel of air” to expand. This continues until it reaches
an altitude similar in pressure and density to its own. As it expands, it cools through the adiabatic process and no heat is
added or withdrawn from the system in which it operates. As air rises, it is cooled because it is expanding by moving to
an altitude where pressure and density is less. This is adiabatic cooling. When the process is reversed and air is forced
downward, it is compressed, causing it to heat by a process called adiabatic heating

**Air Masses**

19034
An air mass is a large body of air (usually 1,700 kilometers or more across) whose physical properties (temperature
and humidity) are horizontally uniform. The weather is a direct result of the continuous alternation of the influences of
warm and cold air masses. Warm air masses predominate in the summer, and cold air masses predominate in the winter.
However, both cold and warm air, alternately, may prevail almost anywhere in the temperature zone at any season. The
basic characteristics of any air mass are temperature and humidity. These properties are relatively uniform throughout the
air mass, and it is by measurement of these properties that the various types of air masses are determined.


-----

**Characteristics**

19035
Air masses acquire the characteristics of the surrounding area, or source region. The characteristics of an air mass consist
of the basic properties of moisture and temperature, which include:

19036

-  Stability.

19037

-  Cloud Types.

19038

-  Sky coverage.

14738

-  Visibility.

19040

-  Precipitation.

19041

-  Icing.

7031

-  Turbulence.

19043
The terrain surface underlying the air mass is the primary factor in determining air mass characteristics.

19044
A source region is typically an area in which the air remains relatively stagnant for a period of days or longer. During
this time of stagnation, the air mass takes on the temperature and moisture characteristics of the source region. Areas of
stagnation can be found in polar regions, tropical oceans, and dry deserts. Air masses are classified by region of origination:

19045

-  Polar or tropical.

19046

-  Maritime or continental.

19047
A continental polar air mass forms over a polar landmass and is characterized by cool and dry conditions. Maritime tropical
air masses form over warm tropical waters like the Caribbean Sea and bring warm, moist air. As the air mass moves from
its source region and passes over land or water, the terrain it passes over modifies its qualities, and thus modifies the nature
of the air mass.

19048
An air mass passing over a warmer surface will be warmed from below, and convective currents form, causing the air to
rise. This creates an unstable air mass with good surface visibility. Moist, unstable air causes cumulus clouds, localized
showers, and turbulence to form. Conversely, an air mass passing over a colder surface does not form convective currents,
but instead creates a stable air mass with poor surface visibility. The poor surface visibility is due to the fact that moisture,
smoke, dust, and other particles cannot rise out of the air mass and are instead trapped near the surface by an inversion. A
stable air mass can produce low stratus clouds and fog.

**Pressure Systems**

19049
The differences that occur with heating and cooling the atmosphere in the lower levels also cause density variations.
These variations cause small horizontal pressure differences that are only about one ten-thousandth of the magnitude
of the normal change of pressure with altitude, but they significantly impact atmospheric circulation and most weather
phenomena. [ _Figure 4-3_ ]


-----

**Figure 4-3.** _High and low pressure systems._

19051
A low or cyclone is a pressure system in which the barometric pressure decreases towards the center and the wind flow
around the system is counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. Unfavorable flying conditions in the form of low
clouds, restricted visibility by precipitation and fog, strong and gusty winds, and turbulence are common in low pressure
systems. Thermal low pressure systems caused by intense surface heating and resulting low air density over barren
continental areas are relatively dry with few clouds and practically no precipitation. Thermal lows are stationary and
predominate over continental areas in the summer. General airflow in a low pressure system, since the atmosphere is
attempting to achieve equilibrium, is in (towards the center of the low pressure system), and up. This tendency can affect
the overall dynamic of the low pressure system.

19052
A high is a pressure system in which the barometric pressure increases toward the center and the wind flow around the
system is clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. Flying conditions are generally more favorable in highs than in lows
because of fewer clouds, light or calm winds, and less concentrated turbulent areas. But, in some situations, visibility may
be reduced due to early morning fog, smog, or haze at flight levels. High pressure systems predominate over cold surfaces
where the air is dense. General airflow in a high pressure system, in reverse of the low pressure dynamic, is out (away from
the center of the pressure system) and down. Again, these airflow tendencies can affect the dynamic of the high pressure
system, much like the low.

19053
In the Northern Hemisphere, a general cycle of highs and lows moves through the temperate zones from west to east. The
movement of the pressure systems is more rapid in the winter season when the low pressure systems are most intense and
the high pressure systems extend farthest to the south. [ _Figure 4-4_ ]


-----

**Figure 4-4.** _A cross-section of the pressure systems depicted in Figure 4-3._

19055
A trough is an elongated area of low pressure, with the lowest pressure along the trough line. The weather in a trough is
commonly violent. Also, troughs can be slow moving.

19056
A ridge is an elongated area of high pressure with highest pressure along the ridge line. The weather in a ridge is generally
favorable for flying.

**Fronts**

19057
Fronts are the boundaries between two air masses and are classified as to which type of air mass (cold or warm) is replacing
the other. For example, a cold front demarcates the leading edge of a cold air mass displacing a warmer air mass. A warm
front is the leading edge of a warmer air mass replacing a colder air mass. Fronts are also transition zones (boundaries)
between air masses that have different densities. The density of air is controlled primarily by the temperature of the air.
Therefore, fronts in temperate zones usually form between tropical and polar air masses, but they may also form between
arctic and polar air masses. A typical surface weather map shows air mass boundary zones at ground level. Designs on
the boundary lines indicate the type of front and its direction of movement. On weather maps in local weather stations,
fronts may also be indicated by colored lines. A working knowledge of fronts and their accompanying weather hazards is
important to pilots.

**Types of Fronts**

19058
The four major frontal types are:

19059

-  Cold.

19060

-  Warm.

19061

-  Stationary.

18388

-  Occluded.

19063
A front type is determined from the movement of the air masses involved.

**_Cold Front_**

19064
A cold front is the leading edge of an advancing mass of colder air. A cold front occurs when a mass of cold, dense,
and stable air advances and replaces a body of warmer air. Cold fronts move more rapidly than warm fronts, generally


-----

progressing at a rate of 25 to 30 miles per hour (mph). However, extreme cold fronts have been recorded moving at
speeds of up to 60 mph. A typical cold front moves in a manner opposite that of a warm front. Because it is so dense, it
stays close to the ground and acts like a snowplow, sliding under the warmer air and forcing the warmer less dense air
aloft. [ _Figure 4-5_ ] The rapidly ascending air causes the temperature to decrease suddenly, forcing the creation of clouds.
The type of clouds that form depends on the stability of the warmer air mass. A cold front in the Northern Hemisphere is
normally oriented in a northeast to southwest manner and can extend for several hundred miles, encompassing a large area
of land. Prior to the passage of a typical cold front, cirriform or towering cumulus clouds are present, and cumulonimbus
clouds are possible. Rain showers and haze are possible due to the rapid development of clouds. The wind from the southsouthwest helps to replace the warm temperatures with the relative colder air. A high dew point and falling barometric
pressure are indicative of imminent cold front passage.

19066
As the cold front passes, towering cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds continue to dominate the sky. [ _Figure 4-6_ ] Depending
on the intensity of the cold front, heavy rain showers form and might be accompanied by lightning, thunder, and/or hail.
More severe cold fronts can also produce tornadoes. During cold front passage, the visibility may be poor, with winds
variable and gusty, and the temperature and dew point drop rapidly. A quickly falling barometric pressure bottoms out
during frontal passage, then begins a gradual increase. After frontal passage, the towering cumulus and cumulonimbus
clouds begin to dissipate to cumulus clouds, with a corresponding decrease in the precipitation. Good visibility eventually
prevails with the winds from the west-northwest. Temperatures remain cooler and the barometric pressure continues to rise.

_the surface position of the front. Convective clouds often develop in the warm air ahead of the front. The warm, wet ground behind the_

_front generates low-level convection and fair-weather cumulus in the cold air_

_Fast-Moving Cold Front_

19068
Fast-moving cold fronts are pushed by intense pressure systems far behind the actual front. [ _Figure 4-7_ ] The friction
between the ground and the cold front retards the movement of the front and creates a steeper frontal surface. This results
in a very narrow band of weather concentrated along the leading edge of the front. If the warm air being overtaken by
the cold front is relatively stable, overcast skies and rain may occur for some distance ahead of the front. If the warm air
is unstable, scattered thunderstorms and rain showers may form. A continuous line of thunderstorms, or squall line, may
form along or ahead of the front. Squall lines present a serious hazard to pilots as squall type thunderstorms are intense and
move quickly. Behind a fast-moving cold front, the skies usually clear rapidly and the front leaves behind gusty, turbulent
winds and colder temperatures.

**_Warm Front_**

19070
A warm front is actually the trailing edge of a retreating mass of cold air. A warm front occurs when a warm mass of air
advances and replaces a body of colder air. Warm fronts move slowly, typically 10 to 25 mph. The slope of the advancing


-----

front slides over the top of the cooler air and gradually pushes it out of the area. Warm fronts contain warm air that often
has very high humidity. As the warm air is lifted, the temperature drops and condensation occurs. Prior to the passage of a
warm front, cirriform or stratiform clouds, along with fog, can be expected to form along the frontal boundary. [ _Figure 4-8_ ]
In the summer months, cumulonimbus clouds (thunderstorms) are likely to develop. Light to moderate precipitation is
probable, usually in the form of rain, sleet, snow, or drizzle, punctuated by poor visibility. The wind blows from the southsoutheast, and the outside temperature is cool or cold, with increasing dew point. Finally, as the warm front approaches,
the barometric pressure continues to fall until the front passes completely.

**Figure 4-8.** _A warm front with overrunning moist, stable air. Clouds are stratiform and widespread over the shallow front._

_Precipitation is continuous and induces widespread stratus in the cold air._

19072
During the passage of a warm front, stratiform clouds are visible and drizzle may be falling. The visibility is generally poor,
but improves with variable winds. The temperature rises steadily from the inflow of relatively warmer air. Usually, the
dew point remains steady and the pressure levels off. After the passage of a warm front, stratocumulus clouds predominate
and rain showers are possible. The visibility eventually improves, but hazy conditions may exist for a short period after
passage. The wind generally blows from the south-southwest. With warming temperatures, the dew point rises and then
levels off. There is generally a slight rise in barometric pressure, followed by a decrease in barometric pressure.

**_Stationary Front_**

19073
When an air mass boundary is neither advancing nor retreating along the surface, the front is called a stationary front.
Although there is no movement of the surface position of a true stationary front, an uplift of air may occur along the frontal
boundary. If the uplifted air is stable and saturated, stratiform clouds may occur. Intermittent drizzle may occur, and if lifted
above the freezing level, icing conditions and frozen precipitation will exist. If the uplifted air is conditionally unstable and
saturation occurs, predominately cumuliform clouds will form, possibly generating thunderstorm activity.

**_Occluded Front_**

19074
An occluded front occurs when a fast-moving cold front catches up with a slow-moving warm front. As the occluded
front approaches, warm front weather prevails, but is immediately followed by cold front weather. There are two types of
occluded fronts that can occur, and the temperatures of the colliding frontal systems play a large part in defining the type
of front and the resulting weather. A cold front occlusion occurs when a fast-moving cold front is colder than the air ahead
of the slow-moving warm front. When this occurs, the cold air replaces the cool air and forces the warm front aloft into the
atmosphere. Typically, the cold front occlusion creates a mixture of weather found in both warm and cold fronts, if the air is
relatively stable. A warm front occlusion occurs when the air ahead of the warm front is colder than the air of the cold front.
When this is the case, the cold front rides up and over the warm front. If the air forced aloft by the warm front occlusion
is unstable, the weather will be more severe than the weather found in a cold front occlusion. Embedded thunderstorms,
rain, and fog are likely to occur.


-----

**_Surface Fronts_**

19075
The air mass boundaries indicated on a surface weather map are called surface fronts. A surface front is the position of a
front at the Earth’s surface. The weather map shows only the location of fronts on the surface, but these fronts also have
vertical extent. For example, the colder, heavier air mass tends to flow under the warmer air mass. The underrunning mass
produces the lifting action of warm air over cold air, causing clouds and associated frontal weather.

19076
The vertical boundary between the warm and cold air masses is a frontal surface, and slopes upward over the colder air
mass. The frontal surface lifts the warmer air mass and produces frontal cloud systems. The slope of the frontal surface
varies with the speed of the moving cold air mass, and the roughness of the underlying terrain. Under normal conditions,
the angle of inclination (slope ratio) between the frontal surface and the Earth’s surface is greater with cold fronts than
with warm fronts. The approximate height of the frontal surface over any station is determined from the analysis of upper
air observations.

19077
Frontal passage (FROPA) affects ballooning activities because it can generate precipitation, wind shifts, significant changes
in temperature, and many other conditions hazardous to ballooning. Balloon pilots usually do not fly in the face of an
approaching front; in fact, many have a rule that they do not fly within 18 to 24 hours prior to frontal passage, particularly
if the approaching front has any significant strength associated with it. The FSS often can advise of the time a cold front
will pass a given reporting station, which assists in flight planning.

**Winds & Currents**

19078
Pressure and temperature changes produce two kinds of motion in the atmosphere—vertical movement of ascending
and descending currents, and horizontal movement in the form of wind. Both types of motion in the atmosphere are
important as they affect the takeoff, landing, and in-flight operations. More important, however, is that these motions in the
atmosphere, otherwise called atmospheric circulation, cause weather changes.

19079
Understanding wind and current circulation patterns is important for a balloon pilot because balloons are maneuvered
solely through interaction with the different layers of wind and current. By using knowledge of the Coriolis force, pressure
gradient force, and surface friction, it is possible to predict with a high degree of accuracy the potential track over the
countryside and land at a predetermined point. This skill is the mark of a competent, safety conscious balloon pilot.

**Atmospheric Circulation**

19080
Three forces cause the wind to move as it does: the Coriolis force, the pressure gradient force, and surface friction. All three
forces work together at the same time.

19081
As defined earlier, atmospheric circulation is the movement of air around the surface of the Earth caused by the uneven
heating of the Earth’s surface that upsets the equilibrium of the atmosphere, creates changes in air movement, and affects
atmospheric pressure. Because the Earth has a curved surface that rotates on a tilted axis while orbiting the sun, the
equatorial regions of the Earth receive a greater amount of heat from the sun than the polar regions. The amount of sun
heating the Earth depends upon the time of day, time of year, and the latitude of the specific region. All of these factors
affect the length of time and the angle at which sunlight strikes the surface.

19082
In general atmospheric circulation theory, areas of low pressure exist over the equatorial regions, and areas of high pressure
exist over the polar regions due to a difference in temperature. Solar heating causes air to become less dense and rise in
equatorial areas. The resulting low pressure allows the high pressure air at the poles to flow along the planet’s surface
toward the equator. As the warm air flows toward the poles, it cools, becoming more dense, and sinks back toward the
surface. [ _Figure 4-9_ ] This pattern of air circulation is correct in theory, but the circulation of air is modified by other forces.


-----

**Air Heated**

-  Expands

-  Decreases density

-  Rises


**Air Cooled**

-  Flows toward Earth

-  Flows back to equator


**Figure 4-9.** _General circulation theory._

19084
The speed of the Earth’s rotation causes the general flow to break up into three distinct cells in each hemisphere.

[ _Figure 4-10_ ] In the Northern Hemisphere, the warm air at the equator rises upward from the surface, travels northward,
and is deflected eastward by the rotation of the Earth. By the time it has traveled one-third of the distance from the equator
to the North Pole, it is no longer moving northward, but eastward. This air cools and sinks in a belt-like area at about 30°
latitude, creating an area of high pressure as it sinks toward the surface. Then, it flows southward along the surface back
toward the equator. Coriolis force bends the flow to the right, thus creating the northeasterly trade winds that prevail from
30° latitude to the equator. Similar forces create circulation cells that encircle the Earth between 30° and 60° latitude, and
between 60° and the poles. This circulation pattern results in the prevailing westerly winds in the conterminous United
States.

19085

**Figure 4-10.** _Three cell circulation pattern caused by the rotation of the Earth._

19086
Circulation patterns are further complicated by seasonal changes, differences between the surfaces of continents and oceans,
and other factors such as frictional forces caused by the topography of the Earth’s surface which modify the movement of
the air in the atmosphere. For example, within 2,000 feet of the ground, the friction between the surface and the atmosphere


-----

slows the moving air. The wind is diverted from its path because the frictional force reduces the Coriolis force. Thus, the
wind direction at the surface varies somewhat from the wind direction just a few thousand feet above the Earth.

**_Coriolis Force_**

19087
The Coriolis force is not perceptible to humans as they walk around because humans move slowly and travel relatively
short distances compared to the size and rotation rate of the Earth. However, the Coriolis force significantly affects bodies
that move over great distances, such as an air mass or body of water.

19088
The Coriolis force deflects air to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, causing it to follow a curved path instead of a
straight line. The amount of deflection differs depending on the latitude. It is greatest at the poles, and diminishes to zero
at the equator. The magnitude of Coriolis force also differs with the speed of the moving body—the faster the speed, the
greater the deviation. In the Northern Hemisphere, the rotation of the Earth deflects moving air to the right and changes the
general circulation pattern of the air.

19089
Pertinent facts about the Coriolis force:

19090

-  The Coriolis force deflection is perpendicular to the flow of air.

19091

-  The Coriolis force will deflect air to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.

19092

-  The Coriolis force is strongest at the Poles and decreases to zero at the Equator.

19093

-  The Coriolis force is zero with calm winds and increases in magnitude as wind speed increases.

19094

-  Coriolis force, in combination with other forces involved, will determine the different circulation patterns over the

Earth.

**_Pressure Gradient_**

19095
Pressure gradient is the difference in pressure between high and low pressure areas. It is the rate of change in pressure in
a direction perpendicular, or across the isobars. Wind speed is directly proportional to the pressure gradient. This means
the strongest winds are in the areas where the pressure gradient is the greatest. Since pressure applied to a fluid is exerted
equally in all directions throughout the fluid, a pressure gradient exists in the horizontal (along the surface), as well as in
the vertical (with altitude) plane in the atmosphere. [ _Figure 4-11_ ]

19096


**Strong or Steep Pressure Gradient**

-  The closer the spacing of isobars,
the stronger the pressure gradient.

-  The stronger the pressure gradient,
the stronger the wind.

**Weak or Flat Pressure Gradient**

-  The wider the pressure gradient,
the weaker the wind.

**Figure 4-11.** _Principles of pressure gradients._


-----

The horizontal pressure gradient is steep or strong when the isobars determining the pressure gradient are close together. It
is flat or weak when the isobars are far apart. If isobars are considered as depicting atmospheric topography, a high pressure
system represents a hill of air, and a low pressure system represents a valley of air. The vertical pressure gradient always
indicates a decrease in pressure with altitude, but the rate of pressure decrease (gradient) varies directly with changes in air
density with altitude. The vertical cross section through a high and a low depicts the surface pressure gradient.

19098
The pressure gradient force is a force that tries to equalize pressure differences. This is the force that causes high pressure
to push air toward low pressure. Thus, air would flow from high to low pressure if the pressure gradient force was the only
force acting on it.

**_Surface Friction_**

19099
Friction is the third component that determines the flow of wind. Because the surface of the Earth is rough, it not only
slows the wind down, it also causes the diverging winds from highs and converging winds near lows. Since the Coriolis
force varies with the speed of the wind, a reduction in the wind speed by friction means a reduction of the Coriolis force.
This results in a momentary disruption of the balance. When the new balance (including friction) is reached, the air flows
at an angle across the isobars from high pressure to low pressure. This angle varies from 10° over the ocean to more than
45° over rugged terrain. Frictional effects on the air are greatest near the ground, but the effects are also carried aloft by
turbulence. Surface friction is effective in slowing the wind up to an average altitude of 2,000 feet above the ground. Above
this level, the effect of friction decreases rapidly and may be considered negligible. Air above 2,000 feet above the ground
normally flows parallel to the isobars. [ _Figure 4-12_ and _Figure 4-13_ ]

**Wind Patterns**

19102
Since air always seeks out lower pressure, it flows from areas of high pressure into those of low pressure. In the Northern
Hemisphere, this flow of air from areas of high to low pressure is deflected to the right and produces a clockwise circulation
around an area of high pressure known as anticyclonic circulation. The opposite is true of low pressure areas; the air flows
toward a low and is deflected to create a counter-clockwise or cyclonic circulation.

19103
High pressure systems are generally areas of dry, stable, descending air. Good weather is typically associated with high
pressure systems for this reason. Conversely, air flows into a low pressure area to replace rising air. This air tends to be
unstable, and usually brings increasing cloudiness and precipitation. Thus, bad weather is commonly associated with areas
of low pressure.

**Convective Currents**

19104
Convection currents refer to the upward moving portion of a convection circulation, such as a thermal or the updraft in
cumulus clouds. The uneven heating of the air, due to different surfaces radiating heat in varying amounts, create small
areas of local circulation. For example, plowed ground, rocks, sand, and barren land give off a large amount of heat, while
water, trees, and other areas of vegetation tend to absorb and retain heat. Convective currents cause the bumpy, turbulent
air sometimes experienced when flying at lower altitudes during warmer weather. On a low altitude flight over varying
surfaces, updrafts are likely to occur over pavement or barren places, and downdrafts often occur over water or expansive
areas of vegetation like a group of trees. Typically, these turbulent conditions can be avoided by flying at higher altitudes.

19105
Convective currents are particularly noticeable in areas with a land mass directly adjacent to a large body of water, such
as an ocean, large lake, or other appreciable area of water. [ _Figure 4-14_ ] During the day, land heats faster than water, so
the air over the land becomes warmer and less dense. It rises and is replaced by cooler, denser air flowing in from over
the water. This causes an onshore wind, called a sea breeze. Conversely, at night land cools faster than water, as does the
corresponding air. In this case, the warmer air over the water rises and is replaced by the cooler, denser air from the land,
creating an offshore wind called a land breeze. This reverses the local wind circulation pattern. Convective currents can
occur anywhere there is an uneven heating of the Earth’s surface.

19107
Convection currents close to the ground can affect a pilot’s ability to control the balloon. On final approach, for example,
the rising air from terrain devoid of vegetation sometimes produces a ballooning effect that can cause a pilot to overshoot
the intended landing spot. On the other hand, an approach over a large body of water or an area of thick vegetation tends
to create a sinking effect that can cause an unwary pilot to land short of the intended landing spot. This could prove
particularly hazardous to a balloon landing in a small, confined area, as the “undershoot” of the approach could potentially
put the balloon into the trees or power lines.

**The Jet Stream**

19108
The jet stream refers to relatively strong winds concentrated in a narrow stream in the atmosphere. These winds are
normally horizontal, high altitude winds. The position and orientation of jet streams vary from day to day. General weather
patterns (hot/cold, wet/dry) are related closely to the position, strength, and orientation of the jet stream (or jet streams).
A jet stream at low levels is known as a low level jet stream. Since it is of interest primarily to high level flight, further
discussion is not necessary.

**Local and Small-Scale Winds**

19109
There are four types of local and small-scale winds to be aware of.

**_Gradient Winds_**

19110
Pressure gradients initiate the movement of air and as soon as the air acquires velocity, the Coriolis force deflects it to the
right in the Northern Hemisphere. As the speed of the air along the isobars increases, the Coriolis force becomes equal and
opposite to the pressure gradient force. After a period of time, the air moves directly parallel to the curved isobars if there


-----

is no frictional drag with the surface. The air no longer moves toward lower pressure because the pressure gradient force
is completely neutralized by the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force.

**_Orographic Winds_**

19111
The term “orographic” has multiple meanings, when placed in the context of weather phenomena. In a general sense,
according to the American Meteorological Society, wind flows that are caused, affected, or influenced by mountains may
be said to be orographic winds flows. The term has come to mean any winds that are affected by terrain, not just mountains;
this definition is probably the most frequently used, when discussing balloon flight.

19112
As a specific term, “orographic lifting” is defined as an ascending air flow caused by mountains. The mechanisms that
produce the orographic lifting fall into two broad categories:

19113

1. The upward deflection of horizontal large-scale air flow by the terrain acting as an obstacle or barrier.

19114

2. The daytime heating of mountain surfaces to produce an anabatic flow (see below) along the slopes and updrafts in
the vicinity of mountain peaks.

19115
This definition, while strictly referring only to lifting by mountains, is sometimes extended to include the effects of hills or
long sloping terrain. When sufficient moisture is present in the rising air, Orographic fog or clouds may form.

**_Anabatic Winds_**

19116
Anabatic winds are those that blow up a steep slope or mountain side. It is sometimes referred to as an upslope flow. These
winds typically occur during the daytime in calm, sunny weather. A hill or mountaintop may be warmed by the sun, which
in turn heats the air just above it. As that air rises through convection, it creates a low pressure region, into which the air at
the bottom of the slope flows, and causes winds.

**_Katabatic Winds_**

19117
Katabatic winds are the reverse of anabatic winds; that is, they flow down slope, and most frequently at night. They are
created by the effect of the air near the ground losing heat thru radiational cooling at a faster rate than air at a similar
altitude over the surrounding land mass.

**Clouds**

19118
Clouds are weather signposts in the sky. They provide the balloon pilot with visible evidence of the atmospheric motion,
water content, and degree of stability. In this sense, clouds are of significant importance to the aeronaut. However, when
they become too numerous or widespread, form at low levels, or show extensive vertical development, they present weather
hazards to ballooning.

19119
Clouds are visible condensed moisture, consisting of droplets of water or crystals of ice. They are supported and transported
by air movements as slow as one-tenth of a mile per hour. Cloud formation is the direct result of saturation producing
processes which take place in the atmosphere. A pilot should be able to identify cloud formations that are associated with
weather hazards. Knowledge of cloud types will also assist the pilot in interpreting weather conditions from weather
reports and existing weather.

**Cloud Formation**

19120
Clouds are often indicative of future weather. For clouds to form, there must be adequate water vapor and condensation
nuclei (miniscule particles of matter like dust, salt, and smoke), as well as a method by which the air can be cooled. When
the air cools and reaches its saturation point, the invisible water vapor changes into a visible state. Through the processes
of sublimation and condensation, moisture condenses or sublimates onto condensation nuclei. The nuclei are important
because they provide a means for the moisture to change from one state to another.


-----

Cloud type is determined by its height, shape, and behavior. They are classified according to the height of their bases as
low, middle, or high clouds, as well as clouds with vertical development. The International Cloud Classification is designed
to provide a uniform cloud classification system. [ _Figure 4-15_ ] Within this system, cloud types are usually divided into
four major groups and further classified in terms of their forms and appearance.

-  Cumulus and cumulonimbus are clouds with vertical
development. Their bases are usually below 6,500 feet, but
may be slightly higher. The tops of the cumulonimbus some
times exceed 60,000 feet.

**Figure 4-15.** _Cloud classification per international agreement._

19123
The four major groups are:

19124

-  Low clouds.

19125

-  Middle clouds.

19126

-  High clouds.

19127

-  Clouds with vertical development.

19128
Cloud classification can be further broken down into specific cloud types according to the outward appearance and cloud
composition. Knowing these terms can help identify visible clouds. The following is a list of cloud classifications:

10105

-  Cumulus—heaped or piled clouds.

18379

-  Stratus—formed in layers.

19131

-  Cirrus—ringlets, fibrous clouds, also high-level clouds above 20,000 feet.

18381

-  Castellanus—common base with separate vertical development, castle-like.

19133

-  Lenticularus—lens shaped, formed over mountains in strong winds.

18383

-  Nimbus—rain-bearing clouds.

18384

-  Fracto—ragged or broken.


-----

-  Alto—meaning high, also middle-level clouds existing at 5,000 to 20,000 feet.

19137
Low clouds are those that form near the Earth’s surface. The low cloud group consists of stratus and stratocumulus clouds.

[ _Figure 4-16_ and _Figure 4-17_ ] Clouds in this family create low ceilings, hamper visibility, and can change rapidly. Because
of this, they influence flight planning and can make visual flight rules (VFR) flight impossible. The bases of these clouds
can start near the surface, with the top extending to 6,500 feet or more above the terrain. Low clouds are of great importance
to the balloon pilot, as they can create low ceilings and poor visibility. The heights of the cloud bases may change rapidly.
If low clouds form below 50 feet, they are classified as fog, and may completely blanket landmarks and landing fields.

19138

**Figure 4-16.** _Stratus clouds._

19139

**Figure 4-17.** _Stratocumulus clouds._


-----

Middle clouds form around 6,500 feet above ground level (AGL) and extend up to 20,000 feet AGL. They are composed
of water, ice crystals, and supercooled water droplets. The middle cloud group consists of altocumulus [ _Figure 4-18_ ],
altostratus, and nimbostratus [ _Figure 4-19_ ] clouds. Altocumulus clouds, which usually form when altostratus clouds are
breaking apart, also may contain light turbulence and icing. Altostratus clouds can produce turbulence and may contain
moderate icing. The altocumulus has many variations in appearance and formation, whereas the altostratus varies mostly
in thickness, from very thin to several thousand feet. Bases of the middle clouds start as low as 6,500 feet and tops can
range as high as 20,000 feet above the terrain. These clouds may be composed of ice crystals or water droplets (which may
be supercooled). Altocumulus rarely produces precipitation, but altostratus usually indicates the proximity of unfavorable
flying weather and precipitation.

19141

**Figure 4-18.** _Altocumulus clouds._

19142

**Figure 4-19.** _Nimbostratus clouds._


-----

High clouds form above 20,000 feet AGL and usually form only in stable air. The high cloud group consists of cirrus,
cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus clouds. The mean base level of these three cloud types starts at 18,000 feet or higher above
terrain. Cirrus clouds [ _Figure 4-20_ ] may give indications of approaching weather changes. Cirriform clouds are composed
of ice crystals, are generally thin, and the outline of the sun or moon may sometimes be seen through them, producing
a halo or corona effect. High clouds are generally of no interest to the balloon pilot, other than they may indicate future
conditions.

19144

**Figure 4-20.** _Cirrus clouds._

19145
Clouds with extensive vertical development are cumulus clouds that build vertically into towering cumulus or cumulonimbus
clouds, often developing into thunderstorms. The bases of these clouds form in the low to middle cloud region, but can
extend into high altitude cloud levels. Towering cumulus clouds indicate areas of instability in the atmosphere, and the air
around and inside them is turbulent. These clouds generally have their bases below 6,500 feet above the terrain and tops
sometimes extend above 60,000 feet. Clouds with extensive vertical development are caused by lifting action, such as
convective currents, orographic lift, or frontal lift.

19146
Scattered cumulus or isolated cumulonimbus clouds seldom present a flight problem, since these clouds can usually be
circumnavigated without difficulty. However, these clouds may rapidly develop in groups or lines of cumulonimbus. They
may also become embedded and hidden in stratiform clouds, resulting in hazardous flight conditions.

19147
Within the high, middle, and low cloud groups are two main subdivisions. These are:

19148

-  Clouds formed when localized vertical currents carry moist air upward to the condensation level. These vertical

development clouds are characterized by their lumpy or billowy appearance, and are designated cumuliform type
clouds, meaning “accumulation” or “heap.” Turbulent flying conditions usually exist in, below, around, and above
cumuliform clouds.

19149

-  Clouds formed when complete layers of air are cooled until condensation takes place. These clouds are stratiform

type clouds, meaning “layered out,” since they lie mostly in horizontal layers or sheets. Flight in stratiform cloud
conditions is usually smooth.

19150
In addition to the two main subdivisions discussed above, is the word nimbus, meaning “rain cloud.” These clouds normally
produce heavy precipitation, either liquid or solid. For example, a stratiform cloud producing precipitation is referred to
as nimbostratus, and a heavy, swelling cumulus cloud that has grown into a thunderstorm is referred to as cumulonimbus


-----

Cumulonimbus clouds contain large amounts of moisture and unstable air, and usually produce hazardous weather
phenomena such as lightning, hail, tornadoes, gusty winds, and wind shear. These extensive vertical clouds can be obscured
by other cloud formations and are not always visible from the ground or while in flight. When this happens, these clouds
are said to be embedded, hence the term, embedded thunderstorms.

10101
To pilots, the cumulonimbus cloud is perhaps the most dangerous cloud type. It appears individually or in groups and is
known as either an air mass or orographic thunderstorm. Heating of the air near the Earth’s surface creates an air mass
thunderstorm; the upslope motion of air in the mountainous regions causes orographic thunderstorms. Cumulonimbus
clouds that form in a continuous line are nonfrontal bands of thunderstorms or squall lines.

19153
Knowledge of principal cloud types and the factors that affect them helps the pilot visualize expected weather conditions,
and to recognize potential weather hazards.

**Ceilings & Visibilities**

19154
Ceilings and visibilities have an important role in the classification of sky conditions, and are critical for the definition of
flight restrictions. It is necessary to define these terms to make those distinctions clear for the balloon pilot.

**_Ceiling_**

19155
For aviation purposes, a ceiling is the lowest layer of clouds reported as being broken or overcast, or the vertical visibility
into an obscuration like fog or haze.

19156
Observations are made using the concept of the “celestial dome,” the hemisphere of sky which can be seen from a specific
point on the ground. Cloud coverage is reported as the total cloud cover at and below a specific layer, and is reported in
one-eighth increments (octals). A ceiling is reported as broken when five-eighths to seven-eighths of the sky is covered
with clouds. Overcast means the entire sky is covered with clouds.

19157
Current ceiling information is reported by the aviation routine weather report (METAR) and automated weather stations of
various types. Ceilings are reported in height AGL.

**_Visibility_**

19158
Closely related to cloud cover and reported ceilings is visibility information. Visibility refers to the greatest horizontal
distance at which prominent objects can be viewed with the naked eye. Visibilities reported in standard weather reports are
horizontal surface visibilities and are generally considered linear. Predominant visibility is the greatest horizontal distance
over which objects can be seen and identified over at least half of the horizon. In the United States, prevailing visibilities
are reported in statute miles and portions thereof.

19159
Since prevailing visibility is used for reporting purposes, three miles visibility does not mean that a pilot must have one
and one half miles visibility in front of and behind the balloon, but that the predominant visibility in most quadrants must
be three miles.

19160
Current visibility is reported in METAR and other aviation weather reports, as well as automated weather stations. Visibility
information is available during a preflight weather briefing.

**Temperature/Dew Point Relationship**

10080
The relationship between dew point and temperature defines the concept of relative humidity. The dew point, given in
degrees, is the temperature at which the air can hold no more moisture. When the temperature of the air is reduced to the
dew point, the air is completely saturated and moisture begins to condense out of the air in the form of fog, dew, frost,
clouds, rain, or snow.


-----

As moist, unstable air rises, clouds often form at the altitude where temperature and dew point reach the same value. When
lifted, unsaturated air cools at a rate of 5.4 °F per 1,000 feet and the dew point temperature decreases at a rate of 1 °F per
1,000 feet. This results in a convergence of temperature and dew point at a rate of 4.4 °F. A pilot can determine the height
of the cloud base by applying the convergence rate to the reported temperature and dew point in the following manner:

19163

Temperature (T) = 85 °F.

19164

Dew point (DP) = 71 °F.

19165

Convergence Rate (CR) = 4.4°.

19166

T – DP = Temperature Dew Point Spread (TDS).

19167

TDS ÷ CR = X.

19168

X x 1,000 feet = height of cloud base AGL

9856
**_Example:_**

19170

85 °F – 71 °F = 14 °F.

19171

14 °F ÷ 4.4 °F = 3.18.

19172

3.18 x 1,000 = 3,180 feet AGL.

19173

The height of the cloud base is 3,180 feet AGL.

19174
**_Explanation:_** With an outside air temperature (OAT) of 85 °F at the surface, and dew point at the surface of 71 °F, the
spread is 14 °F. Divide the temperature dew point spread by the convergence rate of 4.4 °F, and multiply by 1,000 to
determine the approximate height of the cloud base.

19175
This relationship is useful in determining the height of the overlying cloud base when completing preflight preparations.

**Fog**

19176
Fog is a cloud that begins within 50 feet of the surface. It typically occurs when the temperature of air near the ground is
cooled to the air’s dew point. At this point, water vapor in the air condenses and becomes visible in the form of fog. Fog
is classified according to the manner in which it forms and is dependent upon the current temperature and the amount of
water vapor in the air.

19177
Fog is composed of minute droplets of water or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere with no visible downward motion.
It is one of the most common and persistent weather hazards encountered by balloonists. Similar to stratus clouds, the base
of fog is at the Earth’s surface while the base of 4-19 a cloud is at least 50 feet above the surface. Fog may be distinguished
from haze by its dampness and gray color. It is hazardous during takeoffs and landings, as well as the in-flight process,
because it restricts surface visibility. Knowledge of fog formation and dissipation processes, as well as types of fog help
the balloon pilot plan a flight more accurately

**_Fog Formation_**

19178
Since neither condensation nor sublimation occurs unless the relative humidity is near 100 percent, a high relative
humidity is of prime importance in the formation of fog. The natural conditions which bring about a high relative humidity
(saturation) are also fog-producing processes, such as the evaporation of additional moisture into the air or cooling of the
air to its dew point temperature. A high relative humidity can be estimated, from hourly sequence reports, by determining
the spread (difference in degrees) between the temperature and dew point. Fog rarely occurs when the spread is more than
2.2 °C. It is most frequent when the spread is less than 1.1 °C.


-----

A light wind is generally favorable for fog formation. It causes a gentle mixing action, which spreads surface cooling
through a deeper layer of air and increases the thickness of the fog.

19180
Although most regions of the Earth have sufficient condensation nuclei to permit fog formation, the amount of smoke
particles and sulphur compounds in the vicinity of industrial areas is pronounced. In these regions, persistent fog may occur
with above average temperature-dew point spreads.

19181
Fog tends to dissipate when the relative humidity decreases. During this decrease, the water droplets evaporate or ice
crystals undergo sublimation, and the moisture is no longer visible. Either strong winds or heating processes may cause
the decrease in relative humidity.

**_Some Fog Types & Characteristics_**

19182
There are four main types of fog you should be aware of.

_Radiation Fog_

19183
Radiation fog forms after the Earth has radiated back to the atmosphere the heat gained during daylight hours. By early
morning, the temperature at the surface may drop more than 11 °C. Since the dew point temperature (moisture content) of
the air normally changes only a few degrees during the night, the temperature-dew point spread will decrease as the air is
cooled by contact with the cold surface. If the radiational cooling is sufficient, and other conditions are favorable, radiation
fog will form. Radiation fog is most likely when the:

19184

-  Sky is clear (maximum radiational cooling).

19185

-  Moisture content is high (narrow temperature-dew point spread).

19186

-  Wind is light (less than 7 knots).

_Advection Fog_

19187
The movement of warm moist air over a colder surface creates advection fog which is common along coastal regions where
the temperature of the land surface and the water surface contrasts. The southeastern area of the United States provides
ideal conditions for advection fog formation during the winter months. If air flows (advection) from the Gulf of Mexico or
the Atlantic Ocean over the colder continent, this warm air is cooled by contact with the cold ground. If the temperature of
the air is lowered to the dew point temperature, fog will form. Advection fog, forming under these conditions, may extend
over larger areas of the nation east of the Rockies. It may persist throughout the day or night until replaced by a drier air
mass

19188
If advection fog forms over water, it is often referred to as sea fog. Cold ocean currents, such as those off the coast of
California, may cool and saturate moist air coming from the warmer areas of the open sea. Sea fog is often dense offshore,
as well as onshore.

19189
As advection fog moves inland during the winter, the colder land surface often causes sufficient contact cooling to keep the
air saturated. The fog may then persist during the day or with a wind speed of 10 to 15 knots.

_Valley Fog_

19190
During the evening hours, cold dense air will drain from areas of higher elevation into low areas of valleys. As the cool
air accumulates in the valleys, the air temperature may decrease to the dew point temperature, causing a dense formation
of valley fog. While higher elevations may often remain clear throughout the night, the ceiling and visibility become
restricted in the valley.


-----

Fog formed by the addition of moisture to the air is called evaporation fog. The major types of evaporation fog are frontal
fog and steam fog

19192
Frontal fog is normally associated with slow-moving winter frontal systems. Frontal fog forms when liquid precipitation,
falling from the maritime tropical air above the frontal surface, evaporates in the polar air below the frontal surface.
Evaporation from the falling drops may add sufficient water vapor to the cold air to raise the dew point temperature to the
temperature of the air. The cold air will then be saturated, and frontal fog will form. Frontal fog is common with active
warm fronts during all seasons. It occurs ahead of the surface front in an area approximately 100 miles wide. It is, therefore,
frequently mixed with intermittent rain or drizzle. When fog forms ahead of the warm front, it is called prefrontal fog. A
similar fog formation may occur in the polar air along a stationary front. Occasionally, a slow-moving winter cold front
with light wind may generate fog. This fog forms in the polar air behind the surface front and is known as postfrontal fog.

19193
Steam fog forms when cold stable air flows over a non-frozen water surface that is several degrees warmer than the air. The
intense evaporation of moisture into the cold air saturates the air and produces fog. Conditions favorable for steam fog are
common over lakes and rivers in the fall and over the ocean in the winter when an offshore wind is blowing.

**Atmospheric Stability & Instability**

19194
A stable atmosphere resists upward or downward movement, and small vertical disturbances dampen out and disappear.
An unstable atmosphere allows an upward or downward disturbance to grow into a vertical or convective current allowing
small vertical air movements to become larger, resulting in turbulent airflow and convective activity. Instability can lead to
significant turbulence, extensive vertical clouds, and severe weather.

19195
Rising air expands and cools due to the decrease in air pressure as altitude increases. The opposite is true of descending air;
as atmospheric pressure increases, the temperature of descending air increases as it is compressed. This adiabatic process
(heating or cooling) takes place in all upward and downward moving air.

19196
When air rises into an area of lower pressure, it expands to a larger volume. As the molecules of air expand, the temperature
of the air lowers. As a result, when a parcel of air rises, pressure decreases, volume increases, and temperature decreases.
When air descends, the opposite is true.

10072
Since water vapor is lighter than air, moisture decreases air density, causing it to rise. Conversely, as moisture decreases,
air becomes denser and tends to sink. Since moist air cools at a slower rate, it is generally less stable than dry air since
the moist air must rise higher before its temperature cools to that of the surrounding air. The dry adiabatic lapse rate
(unsaturated air) is 3 °C (5.4 °F) per 1,000 feet. The moist adiabatic lapse rate varies from 1.1 °C to 2.8 °C (2 °F to 5 °F)
per 1,000 feet.

10073
The combination of moisture and temperature determine the stability of the air and the resulting weather. Cool, dry air is
very stable and resists vertical movement, which leads to good and generally clear weather. The greatest instability occurs
when the air is moist and warm, as it is in the tropical regions in the summer. Typically, thunderstorms appear on a daily
basis in these regions due to the instability of the surrounding air.

19198
The normal flow of air tends to be horizontal. If this flow is disturbed, a stable atmosphere will resist any upward or
downward displacement. It will tend to return quickly to normal horizontal flow. An unstable atmosphere, on the other
hand, will allow these upward and downward disturbances to grow, resulting in rough (turbulent) air. An example is the
towering thunderstorm which grows as a result of large and intensive vertical movement or air. It climaxes in lightning,
thunder, and heavy precipitation, sometimes including hail.

19199
Atmospheric resistance to vertical motion, called stability, depends upon the vertical distribution of the air’s weight at a
particular time. The weight varies with air temperature and moisture content. In comparing two parcels of air, warmer air
is lighter than colder air, and moist air is lighter than dry air. If air is relatively warmer or moister that its surroundings,
it is forced to rise and would be unstable. If the air is colder or dryer than its surroundings, it will sink until it reaches its
equilibrium, and would be stable. The atmosphere can be at equilibrium only when light air is above heavier air.


-----

Temperature has a significant effect on the stability or instability of the air mass. Air heated near the Earth’s surface on
a hot summer day will rise. The speed and vertical extent of its travel depends on the temperature distribution of the
atmosphere. Vertical air currents, resulting from the rise of air, can vary from the severe downdraft and compensating
downdraft associated with thunderstorms to the closely spaced upward and downward bumps that are felt on warm days
when flying at low levels. Since the temperature of air is an indication of its density, a comparison of temperatures from
one level to another can approximate the degree of the atmosphere’s stability, or how much it will tend to resist vertical
motion.

**Types of Stability**

19201
The five types of atmospheric stability are:

19202

-  Absolute stability.

19203

-  Absolute instability.

19204

-  Conditional instability.

19205

-  Neutral instability.

19206

-  Convective instability.

19207
Absolute stability occurs when the actual lapse rate in a layer of air is less than the moist adiabatic lapse rate; that air is
absolutely stable regardless of the amount of moisture it contains. A parcel of absolutely stable air which is lifted becomes
cooler than the surrounding air and sinks back to its original position as soon as the lifting force is removed.

19208
Similarly, if forced to descend, it becomes warmer than the surrounding air; like a cork in water, it rises to its original
position upon removal of the outside force.

19209
Absolute instability exists when the actual lapse rate in a layer of air is greater than the dry adiabatic lapse rate; that air is
absolutely unstable regardless of the amount of moisture it contains. A parcel of air lifted even slightly will immediately
be warmer than its surroundings, and, as with a hot air balloon, will be forced to rise.

19210
Conditional instability exists when the temperature lapse rate of the air involved lies between the moist and dry adiabatic
rates of cooling. Before the displaced air actually becomes unstable, it must be lifted to a point where it is warmer than the
surrounding air. When this point has been reached, the relatively warmer air continues to rise freely until, at some higher
altitude, its temperature has cooled to the temperature of the surrounding air. In the instability process, numerous variables
tend to modify the air. One of the most important of these variables is the process called entrainment. In this process, air
adjacent to the cumulus or mature thunderstorm is drawn into the cloud primarily by strong updrafts within the cloud. The
entrained air modifies the temperature of the air within the cloud as the two become mixed.

19211
Neutrally stable air is air with the same temperature, and there is no parcel to rise or descend. For example, the surface area
in contact with that air is of the same temperature.

19212
The term convective instability refers to a condition in which the air becomes unstable after lifting. From a physical
standpoint, it closely resembles a conditionally unstable air mass, but has the mechanical lifting of thermal activity
impacting on the overall characteristics of the air.

**Effects of Stable & Unstable Air**

19213
The degree of stability of the atmosphere helps to determine the type of clouds formed, if any. For example, if very
stable air is forced to ascend a mountain slope, clouds will be layer-like with little vertical development and little or no
turbulence. Unstable air, if forced to ascend the slope, would cause considerable vertical development and turbulence in
the cumulus-type clouds.


-----

If air is subsiding (sinking), the heat of compression frequently causes an inversion of temperature which increases the
stability of the subsiding air. When this occurs, as in winter high pressure systems, a surface inversion formed by radiational
cooling is sometimes already present. The subsidence-produced inversion, in this case, will intensify the surface inversion,
placing a strong “lid” above smoke and haze. Poor visibility in the lower levels of the atmosphere results, especially near
industrial areas. Such conditions frequently persist for days, notably in the Great Basin region of the western United States.

**Weather Hazards**

19215
There are many weather hazards that you need to consider.

**Turbulence**

19216
Turbulence is the irregular motion of the atmosphere as indicated by gusts and lulls in the wind. Since turbulence is
associated with many different weather situations, knowledge of its causes and its behavior will help a balloon pilot avoid
or minimize its effects.

19217
Turbulence can be divided into four categories according to the specific causes:

19218

-  Thermal—caused by localized convective currents due to surface heating or unstable lapse rates and cold air moving

over warmer ground or water.

19219

-  Mechanical—resulting from wind flowing over irregular terrain or obstructions.

19220

-  Frontal—resulting from the local lifting of warm air by cold air masses, or the abrupt wind shift (shear) associated

with most cold fronts.

19221

-  Wind shear—marked gradient in wind speed and/or direction due to general vibrations in the temperature and

pressure fields aloft.

19222
Two or more of the above causative factors often work together. In addition, turbulence is produced by man-made
phenomena.

**_Thermal_**

19223
A thermal is simply the updraft in a small-scale convective current. Convective currents (vertical or horizontal air
movements) develop in air, which is heated by contact with a warm surface. This heating from below occurs when either
cold air is advected (moved horizontally) over a warmer surface or the ground is strongly heated by solar radiation.

19224
The strength of convective currents depends in part on the extent to which the Earth’s surface has been heated, which
depends upon the nature of the surface. Barren surfaces, such as sandy or rocky wasteland and plowed fields, are heated
more rapidly than surfaces covered in vegetation. Thus, barren surfaces generally cause stronger convection currents. In
comparison, water surfaces are heated more slowly.

19225
When air is very dry, convective currents may be present although convective-type clouds (cumulus) are absent. The
general upper limits of the convective currents are often marked by the tops of cumulus clouds, which form in them when
the air is moist, or by haze lines. However, turbulence may extend beyond this boundary. Varying types of surfaces, and the
resultant thermal conditions, can affect a balloon to a considerable extent.

19226
The balloon pilot caught in a thermal will recognize the condition by an increase in altitude without application of heat
from the balloon’s heater. This ascent can be rapid and may exceed the maximum rate of climb limitations in the balloon’s
flight manual. Since the air mass is also rising with the balloon, there is no significant pressure against the top of the
balloon. Thus, the top cap will not be pushed open (commonly referred to as “floating the top”).


-----

Depending on their size, some thermals may have a rotative motion similar to a small low pressure system. This motion
draws the balloon in and forces it to fly in an uncontrolled circle. For balloons caught in a thermal, remember the adage
“altitude is your friend.” First, the pilot should insure there is sufficient altitude to clear potential obstacles. Second,
maintain the temperature in the balloon appropriate for level flight. Many pilots attempt to descend immediately, but this
may put the balloon, as well as the passengers, at risk of an uncontrolled descent with possible injury. Most thermals have
a short lift span. In almost all cases, the thermal will “spit” the balloon out the top after a short time, and the pilot may
descend and land as necessary.

**_Mechanical_**

19228
When the air near the surface of the Earth flows over obstructions, such as irregular terrain, (bluffs, hills, mountains)
and buildings, the normal horizontal wind flow is disturbed. As a result, it is transformed into eddies or other irregular
air movements. _Figure 4-21_ shows how the buildings or other obstructions near a launch site or landing field can cause
turbulence.

19229

**Figure 4-21.** _Surface obstructions cause eddies and other irregular air movements._

19230
The strength and magnitude of mechanical turbulence depends on:

19231

-  The speed of the wind.

19232

-  The nature of the obstruction.

19233

-  The stability of the air.

19234

-  The angle at which the wind moves over the obstacle.


-----

Stability seems to be the most important factor in determining the strength and vertical extent of the mechanical turbulence.

**_Frontal_**

19236
Frontal turbulence is cause by the lifting of warm air by a frontal surface, leading to instability and/or the mixing or shear
between the warm and cold air masses. The vertical currents in the warm air are strongest when the warm air is moist and
unstable. The most severe cases of frontal turbulence are generally associated with fast moving cold fronts. In these cases,
mixing between the two air masses, as well as the differences in wind speed and/or direction add to the intensity of the
turbulence.

**_Wind Shear_**

19237
Wind shear is a relatively steep gradient in wind velocity along a given line of direction (either vertical or horizontal) and
produces churning motions (eddies) which result in turbulence. The greater the change of wind speed and/or direction in
the given direction, the greater the shear and associated turbulence.

19238
Clear-air turbulence (CAT), or sudden severe turbulence that occurs in cloudless regions, is associated with wind shear,
particularly between the core of a jet stream and the surrounding air. CAT is not limited to the vicinity of the jet stream and
may occur in isolated regions of the atmosphere. For example, the turbulence in a mountain wave can also be classified as
CAT because the identifying clouds in the wave do not necessarily have to occur for the turbulence to be present.

19239
Sometimes during a climb or descent, a balloon encounters a narrow zone of wind shear with its accompanying turbulence
at the top of a temperature inversion. These inversions occur anywhere from just above the surface to the tropopause.

19240
Strong inversions near the ground are an extreme form of wind shear that adversely affect balloon takeoffs and landings.
For example, a pocket of calm, cold air forms in a valley as a result of nighttime cooling, but the warmer air moving over
it has not been affected appreciably. Due to the difference between the two bodies of air, a narrow layer of very turbulent
air may form. A balloon climbing or descending through this zone will usually encounter considerable turbulence, as well
as changes in lift.

_Low Level Wind Shear_

19241
Wind shear is a sudden, drastic change in windspeed and/or direction over a very small area. Wind shear can subject a
balloon to violent updrafts and downdrafts, as well as abrupt changes to the horizontal movement of the balloon. While
wind shear can occur at any altitude, low level wind shear is especially hazardous due to the proximity of a balloon to the
ground. Directional wind changes of 180° and speed changes of 50 knots or more are associated with low level wind shear.
Low level wind shear is commonly associated with passing frontal systems, thunderstorms, and temperature inversions
with strong upper level winds (greater than 25 knots).

19242
Wind shear is hazardous to a balloon for several reasons. The rapid changes in wind direction and velocity changes the
wind’s relation to the balloon disrupting the normal flight attitude and performance of the balloon.

**Obstructions & Wind**

19243
As mentioned earlier, obstructions on the ground affect the flow of wind and can be an unseen danger, causing yet another
atmospheric hazard for pilots. For example, ground topography and large buildings can break up the flow of the wind
and create wind gusts that change rapidly in direction and speed. Obstructions range from manmade structures, such as
hangars, to large natural obstructions, such as mountains, bluffs, or canyons. A safe pilot is vigilant when flying in or out
of launch or landing sites that have large buildings or natural obstructions located near them.

19244
The intensity of the turbulence associated with ground obstructions depends on the size of the obstacle and the primary
velocity of the wind. This can affect the takeoff and landing performance of a balloon, and can present a very serious
hazard. During the landing phase of flight, a balloon may “drop in” due to the turbulent air and be too low to clear obstacles
during the approach. Disrupted airflow often extends horizontally as much as ten times the height of the object, if the


-----

winds are in the eight to ten knot range. Balloon pilots should be aware of this, and make adjustments accordingly when
attempting to launch next to an obstruction, or when landing just past one.

19245
This same condition is even more noticeable when flying in mountainous regions. While the wind flows smoothly up the
windward side of the mountain and the upward currents help to carry an aircraft over the peak of the mountain, the wind on
the leeward side does not act in a similar manner. As the air flows down the leeward side of the mountain, the air follows
the contour of the terrain and is increasingly turbulent. This tends to push an aircraft into the side of a mountain. The
stronger the wind, the greater the downward pressure and turbulence become.

19246
Due to the effect terrain has on the wind in valleys or canyons, downdrafts may be severe. Thus, a prudent balloonist is
well advised to seek out another balloon pilot with mountain flying experience and get a mountain “checkout” before
conducting a flight in or near mountainous terrain.

**_Mountain Wave_**

19247
A mountain wave is the wavelike effect, characterized by updrafts and downdrafts, that occurs above and behind a mountain
range when rapidly flowing air encounters the mountain range’s steep front. The characteristics of a typical mountain wave
are represented in _Figure 4-22_ which illustrates how air flows with relative smoothness in its lifting component as the
wave current moves along the windward side of the mountain. Wind speed gradually increases, reaching a maximum near
the summit. On passing the crest, the flow breaks into a much more complicated pattern, with downdrafts predominating.

19441

**Breaking wave**

**Rotor turbulence**

**WIND**

**Figure 4-22.** _Characteristics of a mountain wave_

19248
An indication of the possible intensities in the mountain wave is reflected in verified records of sustained downdrafts
and updrafts in excess of 3,000 feet per minute (fpm). Turbulence in varying degrees can be expected, with particularly
severe turbulence in the lower levels. Proceeding downwind 5 to 10 miles from the summit, the airflow begins to ascend
as part of a definite wave pattern. Additional waves, generally less intense than the primary wave, may form downwind.
This event is much like the series of ripples that form downstream from a rock submerged in a swiftly flowing river. The
distance between successive waves (wavelength) usually ranges from 2 to 10 miles, depending on existing wind speed and
atmospheric stability, although waves up to 20 miles apart have been reported.

19249
Characteristic cloud forms peculiar to wave action provide the best means of identification. Lenticular clouds, formed by
mountain waves, are smooth in contour. [ _Figure 4-23_ ] These clouds may occur alone or in layers at heights above 20,000
feet MSL, and be quite ragged when the airflow at that level is turbulent. The roll cloud forms at a lower level, generally
near the height of the mountain ridge. The cap cloud must always be avoided in flight because of turbulence, concealed
mountain peaks, and strong downdrafts on the lee slope. The lenticulars, like the roll and cap clouds, are stationary. They
are constantly forming on the windward side and dissipating on the lee side of the mountain wave.


-----

**Figure 4-23.** _Multiple lenticular clouds over Mount Shasta, California._

**_Rotors_**

19251
Rotors or eddies can also be found embedded in mountain waves. Formation of rotors can also occur as a result of down
slope winds. Their formation usually occurs where wind speeds change in a wave or where friction slows the wind near the
ground. These rotors are often experienced as gusts or wind shear. Clouds may also form within a rotor.

19252
Research on mountain waves and rotors or eddies continues as these phenomena are quite complex, but there is no doubt
that pilots need to be aware of these phenomena and take appropriate precautions. Although mountain wave activity
is normally forecast, many local factors may affect the formation of rotors and eddies. When planning a flight, a pilot
should take note of the winds and terrain to assess the likelihood of waves and rotors. There may be telltale signs in flight,
including disturbances on water or wheat fields and the formation of clouds, provided there is sufficient humidity to allow
cloud formation.

**Thunderstorms**

19253
A thunderstorm is a local storm produced by a cumulonimbus cloud and accompanied by lightning and thunder.
Thunderstorms and cumulonimbus clouds contain many of the most severe atmospheric hazards for the balloon pilot.
They are almost always accompanied by strong gusty winds, severe turbulence, heavy rain showers, and lightning. These
hazards may extend well away from the central core of the thunderstorm mass, sometimes as much as 30 miles or more.

19254
Ceilings and visibility in the precipitation areas under the thunderstorms are normally poor. Because of the heavy
precipitation, the ceiling reported is at best an estimate of where the pilot may break out into visual contact with the surface.
The weather observer determines the vertical visibility into the precipitation, which may be significantly different from the
slant-range of the pilot.

19255
Potentially hazardous turbulence, as well as many other hazards associated with thunderstorms, make a thunderstorm a
dangerous weather formation. The safe balloon pilot avoids any conditions that may expose them to potential thunderstorm
activity. They exercise discretion and good judgment when potential thunderstorm conditions exist.

**_Structure of Thunderstorms_**

19256
It is important to understand the structure of thunderstorms.

_Convective Cells_

19257
The fundamental structural element of the thunderstorm is the unit of convective circulation known as a convective cell.
A mature thunderstorm contains one or more of these cells in different stages of development, each varying in diameter
from one to five miles. By radar analysis and measurement of drafts, it has been determined that each cell is generally


-----

independent of surrounding cells in the same storm. Each thunderstorm progresses through a life cycle from 1 to 3 hours,
depending upon the number of cells contained and their stage of development. In the initial stage (cumulus), the cloud
consists of a single cell. As the development progresses, however, new cells may form as older cells dissipate.

**_Stages in Thunderstorm Development_**

19258
The life cycle of each thunderstorm cell consists of three distinct stages:

19259

-  Cumulus.

19260

-  Mature.

19261

-  Dissipating.

_Cumulus Stage_

19262
Although most cumulus clouds do not become thunderstorms, the initial stage of a thunderstorm is always a cumulus
cloud. [ _Figure 4-24_ ] The chief distinguishing feature of the cumulus or building stage is an updraft that prevails throughout
the entire cell. This updraft may vary from a few feet per second to as much as 6,000 fpm (65 knots) in mature cells. As an
updraft continues through the vertical extent of the cell, water droplets grow in size and raindrops are formed.

19263

**Figure 4-24.** _Congestive cumulus cloud_

_Mature Stage_

19264
The formation of a downdraft and the beginning of surface rain and additional updrafts and downdrafts initiates the
mature stage. [ _Figure 4-25_ ] By this time, the average cell has attained a height of 25,000 feet. As the drops begin to
fall, the surrounding air begins a downward motion because of frictional drag. This descending air will be colder that its
surroundings and its rate of downward motion is accelerated, forming the downdraft. The downdraft reaches maximum
speed a short time after rain begins to fall in the cloud. Downdrafts occur at all levels within the storm, and their speed
ranges from a few feet per minute to about 2,500 fpm (25 knots). Significant downdrafts never extend from the top of
the cell because moisture is not sufficient in the upper levels for raindrops to form. At these high levels, only ice crystals,
snowflakes, and supercooled water are present. Therefore, their rate of fall is insufficient to cause appreciable downdrafts.
The mature cell generally extends far above 25,000 feet—in some cases up to 70,000 feet. In the middle levels, around


-----

14,000 feet, strong updrafts and downdrafts are adjacent to each other. A shear action exists between these drafts and
produces strong and frequent gusts.

19442

**Figure 4-25.** _Mature thunderstorm._

_Dissipating or Anvil Stage_

19265
Throughout the life span of the mature cell, more and more air aloft is entrained by the falling raindrops. Consequently,
the downdraft spreads out to take the place of the weakening updrafts. As this process progresses, the entire lower portion
of the cell becomes an area of downdraft. Since updrafts are necessary to produce condensation and release latent heat
energy, the entire structure begins to dissipate. [ _Figure 4-26_ ] The strong winds aloft carry the upper section of the cloud
into the familiar anvil form (cumulonimbus cloud). However, the appearance of the anvil does not always indicate that the
thunderstorm is dissipating.

19266

**Figure 4-26.** _Dissipating thunderstorm._


-----

A significant thunderstorm hazard is the rapid change in wind direction and wind speed immediately prior to storm passage
at the surface. These strong winds are the result of the horizontal spreading of the storm’s downdraft current as they
approach the surface of the earth. This initial wind surge, as observed at the surface, is known as a first gust. The speed
of this first gust may exceed 75 knots and vary 180° in direction from the previously prevailing surface winds. Firstgust
speeds average about 15 knots over prevailing velocities, and average an approximately 40° change in the direction of the
wind. First gusts usually precede the heavy precipitation, and strong gusts may continue for approximately 5 to 10 minutes
with each thunderstorm cell. First gusts are not limited to the area ahead of the storm’s movement. They may be found in
all sectors, including the area back of the storm’s movement.

19268
surface variations generally occur. These variations usually occur in a particular sequence characterized by:

19269

-  An abrupt fall in pressure as the storm approaches.

19270

-  An abrupt rise in pressure associated with rain showers as the storm moves on and the rain ceases.

19271
All thunderstorms are similar in physical makeup, but for purposes of identification they are divided into two general
groups: frontal and air mass. This division gives the balloon pilot an indication of the method by which the storms are
formed and the distribution of the clouds over the area. The specific nomenclature of these thunderstorms depends upon
the manner in which the lifting action occurs.

_Frontal Thunderstorms_

19272
Thunderstorms may occur within the cloud system of any front: warm, cold, stationary, or occluded. Frontal thunderstorms
are caused by the lifting of warm, moist, conditionally unstable air over a frontal surface. Thunderstorms may also occur
many miles ahead of a rapidly moving cold front, and are called prefrontal or squall line thunderstorms.

19273
Warm front thunderstorms are caused when warm, moist, conditionally unstable air is forced aloft over a colder, denser
shelf of retreating air. Because the frontal surface is shallow, the air is lifted gradually. The lifting condensation level, the
level where air becomes saturated when lifted, is normally reached well before the level of free convection (where lifted
air is warmer than the environmental air and rises on its own), thus producing stratus clouds. The level of free convection
is normally reached in isolated areas along the frontal surface. This is the area where the greatest amount of water vapor is
present in the warm air being lifted. Therefore, warm front thunderstorms are generally isolated to scattered in coverage.
When the level of free convection is reached, warm front thunderstorms may form. These thunderstorms may prove
particularly hazardous, as they are frequently obscured by the surrounding stratiform clouds.

19274
Cold front thunderstorms are caused by the forward motion of a wedge of cold air under a mass of warm, moist, conditionally
unstable air (cold front), increasing the possibility for thunderstorms to develop. The slope of a typical cold frontal surface
is relatively steep, so the lifting condensation level and the level of free convection are usually near the same altitude.
Cold front thunderstorms are typically positioned along the frontal surface in what appears to be a continuous line. These
storms are easily recognized, because they are partly visible from the front and rear of the storm line. However, if the slope
of the frontal surface is shallow, the lifting action is not sufficient to produce thunderstorms in lines (line squalls). With a
shallow front, the thunderstorms form behind the surface front and are widely scattered. Such storms may be concealed by
the surrounding cloud layers.

19275
Lines of thunderstorms frequently develop ahead of rapidly moving cold fronts. These are known as prefrontal squall lines,
and frequently form parallel to the cold front. Prefrontal squall line thunderstorms are usually more violent than cold front
thunderstorms. They are most active between noon and midnight. The cold front cloud system usually weakens during
the period of the greatest prefrontal squall line activity because the warm air displaced by the frontal surface has lost its
moisture and energy in the prefrontal thunderstorms. In the United States, tornadoes are frequently associated with strong
prefrontal squall lines. Pre-frontal squall line thunderstorms are indicated on a surface weather map by an alternate dashdot-dash line (display).


-----

The distribution of stationary front thunderstorms is controlled by the slope of the frontal surface. Steeply sloped stationary
fronts tend to have lines of storms, whereas shallow stationary fronts tend to have widely scattered storms.

19277
Occluded front thunderstorms are associated with the two types of occluded fronts (warm front and cold front occlusions)
and are usually cold front thunderstorms that have been moved into the area of warm frontal weather by the occlusion
process. They are found closer to the low-pressure center and are normally strongest for a distance of 50 to 100 miles north
of the peak of the warm sector.

_Air Mass Thunderstorms_

19278
The two types of air mass thunderstorms are locally convective and orographic. Both types form within air masses, and are
randomly distributed throughout the air mass.

19279
Convective thunderstorms are often caused by solar heating of the land, which provides heat to the air, thereby resulting
in thermal convection. Relatively cool air flowing over a warmer water surface may also produce sufficient convection to
cause thunderstorms. The land-type convective thunderstorms normally form during the afternoon hours, after the Earth
has gained maximum heating from the sun. If cool, moist, conditionally unstable air is passing over this land area, heating
from below will cause convective currents, thereby resulting in towering cumulus or thunderstorm activity. Dissipation
usually occurs during the early evening hours, as the land begins to lose its heat to the atmosphere. Although convective
thunderstorms form as individual cells, they may become so numerous over a particular geographical area that continued
flight cannot be maintained.

19280
Thunderstorms over the ocean are most common during the night and early morning. They frequently occur offshore when
a land breeze is blowing toward the water. The cool land breeze is heated by the warmer water surface, which results in
sufficient convection to produce thunderstorms. After sunrise, heating of the land surface reverses the airflow (sea breeze).
The thunderstorms then dissipate over the water, but they may re-form over the warmer land surface. As an example, the air
mass weather that exists in Florida combines both types of convective thunderstorms. Circulation around a semipermanent
high pressure system off the southeastern United States (Bermuda high) carries moist ocean air over the warm land surface
of the Florida Peninsula. At night, thunderstorms off the Florida Coast are caused by the warm water of the Gulf Stream
heating the surface air, while the upper air is cooling by radiation to space. This heating from below produces thermal
convection over the water. When the sun rises, the heat balance necessary to maintain storm formation over the water
is destroyed. By day, the storms appear to move inward over the land areas, but actually dissipate off the coast and reform over the hot landmass. The heated land surface sets up an unstable lapse rate over the Peninsula and causes storm
development to continue until nocturnal cooling occurs. Usually, convective type storms are randomly distributed and
easily recognized.

19281
Orographic thunderstorms will form on the windward side of a mountain if conditionally unstable air is lifted above the
level of free convection. The storm activity is usually scattered along the individual peaks of the mountains. Occasionally,
however, this activity may form a long unbroken line of storms similar to a squall line. The storms persist as long as
the circulation causes upslope motion. From the windward side of the mountains, identification of orographic storms
may sometimes be difficult because the storm clouds are obscured by other clouds (usually stratiform). Almost without
exception, orographic thunderstorms enshroud mountain peaks or hills.

**_Minimum Factors_**

19282
The minimum factors essential to the formation of a thunderstorm are conditionally unstable air with relatively high
moisture content and some type of lifting action. Lifting of warm air will not necessarily cause free convection. The
air may be lifted to a point where the moisture condenses and clouds form. These cloud layers, however, will be stable
if the level of free convection has not been reached by the lifting. Conversely, it is possible for dry heated air to rise
convectively without the formation of clouds. In this condition, turbulence might be experienced in perfectly clear weather.
Cumulonimbus cloud formations require a combination of conditionally unstable air, some type of lifting actions, and high
moisture content. Once a cloud has formed, the latent heat of condensation released by the change of state from vapor to
liquid tends to make the air more unstable.


-----

Some type of external lifting action is necessary to bring the warm surface air to the point where it will continue to rise
freely (the level of free convection). For example, an air mass may be lifted by thermal convection, terrain, fronts, or
convergence.

**Thunderstorms**

19284
By no means is the information contained here a complete discussion of all the weather information and factors affecting
balloon flight. There are many resources available, both through government and private agencies, which may be of value
to the pilot in planning a flight. A pilot should take the time to explore the internet, read weather books, and gain a complete
understanding of the myriad of weather information and products that are available.

19285
The second section of this chapter will expose the reader to some of the weather reporting products available, both through
FSS briefings and Internet searches. With the knowledge gained from the first half of this chapter, the pilot will be able to
make a good interpretation of the reports, and determine how present and future conditions will affect the decision to fly.

**How to Obtain Weather Information**

19286
An integral part of flight preparation for any pilot is checking the weather conditions expected to occur during the flight.
FAA regulations place the responsibility for flight planning on the pilot. To effectively plan a flight, a pilot needs to
understand what weather information is available, how to obtain it, and how it can be applied to a flight.

19287
While weather forecasts are not 100 percent accurate, meteorologists, through careful scientific study and computer
modeling, have the ability to predict the weather patterns, trends, and characteristics with increasing accuracy. Through a
complex system of weather services, government agencies, and independent weather observers, pilots and other aviation
professionals receive the benefit of this vast knowledge base in the form of up-to-date weather reports and forecasts. These
reports and forecasts enable pilots to make informed decisions regarding weather and flight safety.

**Sources for Weather Information**

19288
There are many sources available for today’s pilot when gathering information about weather prior to a flight. A review
of pertinent weather reports and information is required by FAA regulations and the following sources provide excellent
weather information. For the balloon pilot, experience and study helps them determine the preferred sources for weather
information.

**_FAA Flight Service Stations (FSS)_**

19289
The FAA FSS is the primary source for preflight weather information. FSS can be contacted by calling 1-800- WXBRIEF. It
also logs pilot contacts to provide background information in the event of an accident or incident, as well as substantiating
workload statistics. It is one of the two sources of an official weather briefing.

19290
The FAA has contracted flight briefings to private contractor. To receive information on a flight briefing, you can either
call 1-800-wxbrief (992-7433) or go to their [website](https://www.1800wxbrief.com/Website/#!/) and create a profile.

56041
To get a flight briefing, you will need to input a variety of information related to your flight, including cruising speed and
cruising altitude (referred to as ‘level’). For the speed, you will need to follow the ICAO format, by typing N0 followed
by your anticipated speed (in knots). For the (flight) level, the pilot has multiple options. For the majority of flights, pilots
could just type ‘VFR’ in the space provided. If a pilot is planning on an extended flight at a particular level below 18,000
feet MSL, they can enter that particular level by AXXX where the first placeholder is tens of thousands of feet, the second
place holder is in thousands of feet, and the third placeholder is in hundreds of feet. For example, if a pilot was planning
a flight at 8500 feet MSL, the correct entry would be A085.

**_Internet Sources_**

19291
A wealth of internet sources exist for the balloon pilot seeking information about current weather conditions.


-----

-  The [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/) has weather offices across the country that supply the latest weather information. At

this site, you can click on the map anywhere in the country which will take you to the local office webpage. On the
local office page, one can click of the local map to get a localized forecast along with the closest current observation.

On the local forecast page under the “forecasts” sub-menu, there is an option tilted “forecast discussion”. There you
can find a discussion where the greatest weather concerns over the next seven days are discussed. There, you can
also find an aviation discussion. This discussion provides a window into the head of the forecaster that drafted the
TAFs, and may highlight weather concerns in greater detail than the TAFs allow.

19296

**Figure 4-27.** _This map can be used to gather hourly AWOS and ASOS type weather information from various sites in each state._

19297

-  National Center for Atmospheric Research and the [University Corporation for Atmospheric Research](http://www.ucar.edu) —a

collaborative effort of research centers, universities, and weather offices around the United States, this site provides
numerous real-time and forecast weather products and graphics.

19299

-  [Aviation Weather Center (AWC)](http://www.aviationweather.gov) — makes text, digital and graphical forecasts, analyses, and observations of aviation

related weather variables available to the aviation community.

19301

-  [Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS)](https://www.aviationweather.gov/hemst) Weather Display —the ADDS development team created an

experimental tool designed to show weather conditions for short-distance and low-altitude flights common for the
helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) community at the request of the FAA. This interactive site allows
the user to determine ceiling and visibility and winds (at 500 foot increments) for an area as small as 5 km*2. While
not specifically targeted nor designed for the balloon pilot’s use, the information obtained from this site is helpful to
the pilot planning a flight at some distance from a normal weather reporting facility.

**Interpreting Weather Charts & Reports**

19304
A weather chart is any chart or map that presents data and analysis that describe the state of the atmosphere over an
extended region at a given time. Weather charts provide a picture of the overall movement of major weather systems and
fronts and are used in flight planning.

19305
Three useful weather charts for balloon pilots are: surface analysis, weather depiction, and radar summary charts. These
three charts present current weather information and provide “big picture” information for weather systems across the


-----

United States. The composite moisture stability chart, constant pressure analysis charts, and significant weather prognostic
charts provide additional information for flight planning.

19306
Knowledge of all these weather charts, reports, and forecasts may not be necessary for the pilot planning a local flight, but
an understanding of large scale weather patterns and systems bring a greater understanding of how those systems affect
local weather. It is important to gain an understanding of the primary charts used, and develop interpolation skills to be able
to perform safe, adequate flight planning.

**_Surface Analysis Chart_**

19307
The surface analysis chart is computer-generated, covers the contiguous 48 states and adjacent areas, and is transmitted every
3 hours with an analysis of the current surface weather. It shows the areas of high and low pressure, fronts, temperatures,
dew points, wind directions and speeds, local weather, and visual obstructions. [ _Figure 4-28_ ]

19308

**Figure 4-28.** _Example of a section of a surface analysis chart with station model legend (inset)._

19309
Surface weather observations for reporting points across the United States are also depicted on this chart. Each of these
reporting points is illustrated by a station model.

19310

-  Type of observation—a round model indicates an official weather observer made the observation. A square model

indicates the observation is from an automated station. Stations located offshore give data from ships, buoys, or
offshore platforms.

19311

-  Sky cover—the station model depicts total sky cover and will be shown as clear, scattered, broken, overcast, or

obscured/partially obscured.


-----

-  Clouds—cloud types are represented by specific symbols. Low cloud symbols are placed beneath the station model,

while middle and high cloud symbols are placed directly above the station model. Typically, only one type of cloud
will be depicted with the station model.

19313

-  Sea level pressure—sea level pressure given in three digits to the nearest tenth of a mb. For 1,000 mb or greater,

prefix a ten to the three digits. For less than 1,000 mb, prefix a nine to the three digits.

18666

-  Pressure change/tendency—pressure change in tenths of mb over the past 3 hours. This is depicted directly below

the sea level pressure.

19315

-  Precipitation—a record of the precipitation that has fallen over the last 6 hours to the nearest hundredth of an inch.

19316

-  Dew point—dew point is given in degrees Fahrenheit.

19317

-  Present weather—over 100 different weather symbols are used to describe the current weather.

19318

-  Temperature—temperature is given in degrees Fahrenheit.

19319

-  Wind—true direction of wind is given by the wind pointer line, indicating the direction from which the wind is

coming. A short barb is equal to five knots of wind, a long barb is equal to ten knots of wind, and a pennant is equal
to 50 knots.

**_Weather Depiction Chart_**

19320
A weather depiction chart details surface conditions as derived from METAR and other surface observations. It is prepared
and transmitted by computer every 3 hours beginning at 0100 Zulu time (0100Z), and is valid at the time of the plotted data.
Designed to be used for flight planning, it gives an overall picture of the weather across the United States. [ _Figure 4-29_ ]

19321

**Figure 4-29.** _Weather depiction chart. On aviationweather.gov, the user can display data they are interested in, and zoom in on regions_

_of the country if interested. Surface observations are color-coded based on flight category.  Other user defined overlays include:_

_radar, satellite, sigmets, airmets and METARS._


-----

The weather depiction typically displays major fronts or areas of high and low pressure. It also provides a graphic display
of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), VFR, and marginal VFR (MVFR) weather. Areas of IFR conditions (ceilings less than
1,000 feet and visibility less than 3 miles) are shown by a hatched area outlined by a smooth line. MVFR regions (ceilings
1,000 to 3,000 feet, visibility 3 to 5 miles) are shown by a non-hatched area outlined by a smooth line. Areas of VFR (no
ceiling or ceiling greater than 3,000 feet and visibility greater than 5 miles) are not outlined. Weather depiction charts show
a modified station model that provides sky conditions in the form of total sky cover, cloud height or ceiling, weather, and
obstructions to visibility, but does not include winds or pressure readings like the surface analysis chart. A bracket ( ] )
symbol to the right of the station indicates the observation was made by an automated station.

19323
A detailed explanation of a station model is depicted in the previous discussion of surface analysis charts.

**_Radar Summary Chart (SD)_**

19324
A radar summary chart [ _Figure 4-30_ ] is a computer-generated graphical display of a collection of automated radar
weather reports (SDs). The chart is published hourly, 35 minutes past the hour. It displays areas of precipitation as well as
information regarding the characteristics of the precipitation. An SD chart includes:

19325

**Figure 4-30.** _Radar summary chart_

19326

-  No information—if information is not reported, the chart will read “NA.” If no echoes are detected, the chart will

read “NE.”

19327

-  Precipitation intensity contours—intensity can be described as one of six levels and is shown on the chart by three

contour intervals.

19328

-  Height of tops—the heights of the echo tops are given in hundreds of feet MSL.


-----

-  Movement of cells—individual cell movement is indicated by an arrow pointing in the direction of movement. The

speed of movement in knots is the number at the top of the arrow head. “LM” indicates little movement.

19330

-  Type of precipitation—the type of precipitation is marked on the chart using specific symbols.

19331

-  Echo configuration—echoes are shown as areas, cells, or lines.

19332

-  Weather watches—severe weather watch areas for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms are depicted by boxes

outlined with heavy dashed lines.

19333
A valuable tool for preflight planning, the SD chart has several limitations. Since it depicts only areas of current precipitation,
it will not show areas of clouds and fog with no appreciable precipitation, or the height of the tops and bases of the clouds.
SD charts should be used in conjunction with current METAR and weather forecasts.

**_Composite Moisture Stability Chart_**

19334
The composite moisture stability chart is a chart composed of four panels depicting stability, precipitable water, freezing
level, and average relative humidity conditions. This computer-generated chart contains data obtained from upper-air
observations, is updated twice a day, and shows the relative stability of the air mass and the potential for thunderstorms or
thermal activity.

**_Stability/Lifted Index Chart_**

19335
A subdisplay of the composition moisture stability chart is the stability or lifted index (LI) chart, a valuable tool for
determining the stability of the atmosphere. The stability or LI chart is the upper left hand panel of the composite moisture
stability chart. Two indexes represent the moisture and stability of the air: the K index (KI) and the LI, with these numbers
composing a fraction. KI (denominator of the fraction) provides moisture and stability information. Values range from high
positive values to low negative values. A high positive KI indicates moist, unstable air. KI values are considered high when
at or above +20, and low when less than +20. [ _Figure 4-31_ ]


-----

**Figure 4-31.** _Lifted index chart._

19337
The LI (numerator of the fraction) is a common measure of atmospheric stability. It is calculated by hypothetically lifting
a parcel of air to the 500 mb level, approximately 18,000 feet MSL, and analyzing its stability at that level. A positive LI
indicates that a particular parcel of air is stable at that level and resists further upward motion. Large positive values (+8 or
greater) would indicate very stable air. Conversely, a negative LI means that a lifted surface parcel of air is unstable, and
more likely to rise. Large negative values (–6 or more) indicate very unstable air.

19338
The KI and LI can be used together to determine the moisture and stability characteristics of a particular air mass. The air
masses may be classified as moist and stable, moist and unstable, dry and stable, or dry and unstable. This determination
allows the balloon pilot to make an informed decision regarding the likelihood of thermal and potential thunderstorms, and
if a safe flight can be conducted.

**_Constant Pressure Analysis Charts_**

19339
A constant pressure analysis chart or isobaric chart is a weather map representing conditions on a surface of equal
atmospheric pressure. [ _Figure 4-32_ ] For example, a 500 mb chart will display conditions at the level of the atmosphere at
which the atmospheric pressure is 500 mb. The height above sea level at which the pressure is that particular value may
vary from one location to another at any given time, and also varies with time at any one location, so it does not represent
a surface of constant altitude/height.


-----

**Figure 4-32.** _Constant pressure analysis chart._

19341
Constant pressure charts provide the pilot with a clearer picture of how the atmosphere behaves at different altitudes and
pressures. For example, a low pressure system that seems insignificant based on surface observations may prove to be a
major factor in the weather at five or ten thousand feet.

19342
Constant pressure charts are prepared for selected values of pressure and present weather information at various altitudes.
Standard charting values are at 850 mb (approximately 5,000 feet MSL), 700 mb (approximately 10,000 feet MSL), 500
mb (approximately 18,000 feet MSL), as well as higher and lower altitudes. Charts with higher pressure altitudes present

information at lower altitudes, and charts with lower pressure altitudes present information at higher altitudes.

19343
Symbology on the constant pressure analysis chart is the same as that of the surface analysis chart. This chart depicts
the information at a specific pressure altitude. When compared with the surface analysis of the same time frame, a threedimensional concept of the atmosphere can be conceptualized, and the pilot can gain a greater understanding of the
atmospheric dynamics involved in weather patterns.

**_Significant Weather Prognostic Charts_**

19344
Significant weather prognostic charts [ _Figure 4-33_ ] display the observed or forecast significant weather phenomena at
different flight levels that may affect the operation of aircraft. They are available for low-level significant weather from the
surface to FL 240 (24,000 feet), also referred to as the 400 mb level, and high-level significant weather from FL 250 to FL
600 (25,000 to 60,000 feet). This discussion involves the low-level significant weather prognostic chart.


-----

**Figure 4-33.** _Significant weather prognostic chart._

19346
The low-level chart comes in two forms: the 12- and 24-hour forecast chart, and the 36- and 48-hour surface only forecast
chart. The first chart is a four-panel chart that includes 12- and 24-hour forecasts for significant weather and surface weather.
Charts are issued four times a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z. The valid time for the chart is printed on the lower
left corner of each panel. The upper two panels show forecast significant weather, which may include nonconvective
turbulence, freezing levels, and IFR or MVFR weather. Areas of moderate or greater turbulence are enclosed in dashed
lines. Numbers within these areas give the height of the turbulence in hundreds of feet MSL. Figures below the line show
the anticipated base, while figures above the line show the top of the zone of turbulence. Also shown on this panel are
areas of VFR, IFR, and MVFR. IFR areas are enclosed by solid lines, MVFR areas are enclosed by scalloped lines, and
the remaining, unenclosed area is designated VFR. Zigzag lines and the letters “SFC” (surface) indicate freezing levels in
that area are at the surface. Freezing level height contours for the highest freezing level are drawn at 4,000 foot intervals
with dashed lines.

**Additional Weather Information**

19347
Some additional things you should know about the weather are as follows.

**_Skew-T Plots_**

19348
Most weather information is derived from radiosondes, or weather balloons, that are released from over 100 stations in
the United States twice daily (00Z and 12Z). The observations of temperature and humidity at various pressure altitudes
are transmitted back to the releasing station; the radiosondes are also tracked by radar in order to determine wind speed
and direction. This information is plotted to create a diagram known as a Skew-T/Log-P plot, commonly referred to as a
Skew-T. These plots can be found at many different online weather sites.The appropriate plot for any of the reporting sites
can be found by typing in the closest reporting station identifier (usually an airport), and allowing the graphic to load.

19349
There is a wealth of information that may be derived from the Skew-T plot (or “sounding,” as it may be referred to), but
this discussion will be limited to those features of immediate interest to the average balloon pilot.

19350
Some of the information that may be derived from the SkewT, using the example in _Figure 4-34_ :


-----

-  The two lines running vertically through the center of the graphic (red and blue) show the temperature and dew point

for a specific location at ascending pressure altitudes. The temperature is always plotted to the right of the dew point
because temperature is almost always greater than the dew point temperature.

19352

-  The right side margin shows wind speed and direction, using the standard “barbed” system common in weather

reporting. The scale (in this case, 0 to 40 knots) can be changed, but this setting provides the best resolution.

19353

-  The left margin of the chart indicates the pressure altitude for a particular reading. Pressure altitude readings

correspond generally to certain altitudes. For example, the reading at 850 mb equates roughly to an altitude of 5,000
feet above MSL. That may not appear to be useful; however, this is where the dynamics of the application come into
play. If the computer cursor is moved over the graphic part of the diagram, indicators as to the specific information
for that altitude may be seen (not depicted in _Figure 4-34_ ). A pilot may be able to get information for varying
altitudes as close at 125 feet apart, depending on the resolution of the original sounding information.

19354

**Figure 4-34.** _Example of a Skew-T plot._

19355
There is a tutorial available to fully explain the data interpretation of the Skew T plot [here](http://flsc.org/portals/12/PDF/Read_Skew_T.pdf) .

**_Velocity Azimuth Display (VAD)Winds_**

19356
Velocity Azimuth display (VAD) winds are derived from the output of the 160 WSR-88 radar sites located throughout the
United States. These radar systems are used by weather professionals to produce many different products, including the
weather radar depictions found on many of the web sites previously discussed, as well as various television station weather
reporting. [ _Figure 4-35_ ]


-----

**Figure 4-35.** _VAD wind graphic._

19357
The WSR-88 radar systems can be configured to produce radar returns from dust and other particulate matter that may
be in the air. These radar returns can be processed to indicate wind direction and speed at different altitudes. VAD winds
are generally reported in 1,000 foot increments, although at times reports may be as small as 150 feet between altitudes.
Standard “wind barb” depictions are used to represent the wind direction and speed at different altitudes.

19358
The College of Dupage has a [website](https://weather.cod.edu) with current weather observations (analysis), satellite and radar information,
including, data from the GOES 16/17, meso sector information, VAD radar data, and numerical models where you can
left click on any model output and get a forecast skew-t for any particular location. This data-filled website is located at:

**Additional Weather Information**

19359
Observed weather condition reports are often used in the creation of forecasts for the same area. A variety of different
forecast products are produced and designed to be used in the preflight planning stage. Pilots need to be familiar with the
following printed forecasts: wind and temperature aloft forecasts (FD reports), the terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF),
aviation area forecast (FA), and in-flight weather advisories (SIGMET, AIRMET).

**_Wind and Temperature Aloft Forecast (FD Report)_**

19360
Wind and temperature aloft forecasts provide wind and temperature forecasts for specific locations in the contiguous
United States, plus network locations in Hawaii and Alaska. The forecasts are made twice a day based on the radiosonde


-----

upper air observations taken at 0000Z and 1200Z. Up through 12,000 feet are true altitudes; at and above 18,000 feet are
pressure altitudes. Wind direction is always in reference to true north, and wind speed is given in knots. The temperature is
given in degrees Celsius; no winds are forecast when a given level is within 1,500 feet of the station elevation. Similarly,
temperatures are not forecast for any station within 2,500 feet of the station elevation. If the wind speed is forecast to be
greater than 100 knots but less than 199 knots, the computer adds 50 to the direction and subtracts 100 from the speed. A
sample FD report is shown in _Figure 4-36_ .

27112

**Figure 4-36.** _Sample FD report._

19361
To decode this type of data group, the reverse process must be accomplished. For example, when the data appears as
“731960,” subtract 50 from the 73 and add 100 to the 19; the wind would be 230° at 119 knots with a temperature of –60°C.


-----

If the wind speed is forecast to be 200 knots or greater, the wind group is coded as 99 knots. When the data appears as
“7799,” subtract 50 from 77 and add 100 to 99; the wind is 270° at 199 knots or greater. When the forecast wind speed is
calm or less than 5 knots, the data group is coded “9900,” which means light and variable.

**_Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR)_**

19362
METAR is an observation of current surface weather reported in a standard international format. While the METAR code
has been adopted worldwide, each country is allowed to make modifications to the code. This discussion of METAR will
cover elements used in the United States.

19363
**_Example:_** METAR KGGG 161753Z AUTO 14021G26 3/4SM +TSRA BR BKN008 OVC012CB 18/17 A2970 RMK
PRESFR

9858
A typical METAR report contains the following information in sequential order:

19365

1. Type of report—the first of two types of METAR reports is the routine METAR report that is transmitted every hour.
The second is the aviation selected special weather report (SPECI). This is a special report that can be given at any
time to update the METAR for rapidly changing weather conditions, aircraft mishaps, or other critical information.

19366

2. Station identifier—each station is identified by a four-letter code as established by the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO). In the 48 contiguous states, a unique three-letter identifier is preceded by the letter “K.”
For example, Gregg County Airport in Longview, Texas, is identified by the letters “KGGG,” K being the country
designation and GGG being the airport identifier. In other regions of the world, including Alaska and Hawaii, the
first two letters of the four-letter ICAO identifier indicate the region, country, or state. Alaska identifiers always
begin with the letters “PA” and Hawaii identifiers always begin with the letters “PH.” A list of station identifiers can
be found at an FSS or NWS office or on the [NOAA’s website](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/findstation) .

19367

3. Date and time of report—are depicted in a six-digit group (e.g., 161753Z). The first two digits of the sixdigit group
are the date. The last four digits are the time of the METAR, which is always given in Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC). A “Z” is appended to the end of the time to denote the time is given in Zulu time (UTC) as opposed to local
time.

19368

4. Modifier—denotes that the METAR came from an automated source or that the report was corrected. If the notation
“AUTO” is listed in the METAR, the report came from an automated source. It also lists “AO1” or “AO2” in the
remarks section to indicate the type of precipitation sensors employed at the automated station. When the modifier
“COR” is used, it identifies a corrected report sent out to replace an earlier report that contained an error (for
example: METAR KGGG 161753Z COR).

19369

5. Wind—reported with five digits (e.g., 14021) unless the speed is greater than 99 knots, which requires six digits.
The first three digits indicate the direction of the wind is blowing in tens of degrees with 0/360 from the north, 90
from the east, 180 from the south, and 270 from the west. If the wind is variable, it is reported as “VRB.” The last
two digits indicate the speed of the wind in knots (KT) unless the wind is greater than 99 knots, which requires
three digits. If the winds are gusting 5 knots or greater over the sustained speed, the letter “G” follows the wind
speed. After the letter “G,” the peak gust recorded is provided (e.g., 21G26). If the wind varies more than 60° and
the wind speed is greater than 6 knots, a separate group of numbers, separated by a “V,” will indicate the extremes
of the wind directions.

19370

6. Visibility—the prevailing visibility (e.g., 3/4 SM) is reported in statute miles as denoted by the letters “SM.” It
is reported in both miles and fractions of miles. At times, runway visual range (RVR) is reported following the
prevailing visibility. RVR is the distance a pilot can see down the runway in a moving aircraft. When RVR is
reported, it is shown with an R, then the runway number followed by a slant, then the visual range in feet. For
example, when the RVR is reported as R17L/1400FT, it translates to a visual range of 1,400 feet on runway 17 left.

7. Weather—broken down into two different categories: qualifiers and weather phenomenon (e.g., +TSRA BR). First,
the qualifiers of intensity, proximity, and the descriptor of the weather will be given. The intensity may be light (–),


-----

moderate ( ), or heavy (+). Proximity depicts only weather phenomena that are in the airport vicinity. The notation
“VC” indicates a specific weather phenomenon is in the vicinity of 5 to 10 miles from the airport. Descriptors
are used to describe certain types of precipitation and obscurations. Weather phenomena may be reported as
being precipitation, obscurations, and other phenomena such as squalls or funnel clouds. Descriptions of weather
phenomena as they begin or end, and hailstone size are also listed in the remarks sections of the report.

19372

8. Sky condition—always reported in the sequence of amount, height, and type or indefinite ceiling/height (vertical
visibility) (e.g., BKN008 OVC012CB). The heights of the cloud bases are reported with a three-digit number in
hundreds of feet above the ground. Clouds above 12,000 feet are not detected or reported by an automated station.
The types of clouds, specifically towering cumulus (TCU) or cumulonimbus (CB) clouds, are reported with their
height. Contractions are used to describe the amount of cloud coverage and obscuring phenomena. The amount of
sky coverage is reported in eighths of the sky from horizon to horizon.

19373

9. Temperature and dew point—always given in degrees Celsius (e.g., 18/17). Temperatures below 0 °C are preceded
by the letter “M” to indicate minus.

19374

10. Altimeter setting—reported as inches of mercury in a four-digit number group, and is always preceded by the

letter “A” (e.g., A2970). Rising or falling pressure may also be denoted in the remarks sections as “PRESRR” or
“PRESFR” respectively.

19375

11. Remarks—comments may or may not appear in this section of the METAR. The information contained in this

section may include wind data, variable visibility, beginning and ending times of particular phenomenon, pressure
information, and various other information deemed necessary. An example of a remark regarding weather
phenomenon that does not fit in any other category would be: OCNL LTGICCG. This translates as occasional
lightning in the clouds, and from cloud to ground. Automated stations also use the remarks section to indicate the
equipment needs maintenance. The remarks section always begins with the letters “RMK.”

**_Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF)_**

19390
A terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF) is a report established for the five statute mile radius around an airport. TAF reports
are usually given for larger airports. Each TAF is valid for a 24- hour period, and is updated at a minimum of four times
a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z. TAF utilizes the same descriptors and abbreviations as used in the METAR
report.

19391
The terminal forecast includes the following information in sequential order:

19392

1. Type of report—TAF can be either a routine forecast (TAF) or an amended forecast (TAF AMD).

19393

2. ICAO station identifier—The station identifier is the same as that used in a METAR.

19394

3. Date and Time of Origin—reported in a six-digit code. The first two indicate the date, the last four indicate the time.
Time is always given in UTC as denoted by the “Z” following the number group.

19395

4. Valid period date and time—the valid forecast time period is reported in a six-digit number group. The first two
numbers indicate the date, followed by the two-digit beginning time for the valid period, followed by the two digit
ending time.

19396

5. Forecast Wind—the wind direction and speed forecast are reported in a five-digit number group. The first three
digits indicate the direction of the wind in reference to true north. The last two digits state the windspeed in knots,
as denoted by the letters “KT.” 4-39 As in the METAR, winds greater than 99 knots are given in three digits.

19397

6. Forecast visibility—reported in statute miles, in whole numbers or fractions. If the forecast visibility is greater than
6 miles, it will be coded as “P6SM.”

19398

7. Forecast significant weather—weather phenomenon is coded in the TAF reports in the same format as the METAR.
If no significant weather is expected during the forecast time period, the denotation “NSW” will be included in the
“becoming” or “temporary” weather groups.

19399

8. Forecast sky condition—reported in the same manner as the METAR. Only cumulonimbus (CB) clouds are forecast
in this portion of the TAF report as opposed to CBs and towering cumulus in the METAR.

19400

9. Forecast change group—for any significant weather change forecast to occur during the TAF time period, the
expected conditions and time period are included in this group. This information may be shown as From (FM),
Becoming (BECMG), and Temporary (TEMPO). “From” is used when a rapid and significant change, usually
within an hour, is expected. “Becoming” is used when a gradual change in the weather is expected over a period of
no more than 2 hours. “Temporary” is used for temporary fluctuations of weather, expected to last for less than an
hour.

19401

10. Probability forecast—a given percentage that describes the probability of thunderstorms and precipitation occurring

in the coming hours. This forecast is not used for the first 6 hours of the 24-hour forecast.

thunderstorms with moderate rain showers clouds overcast at 3,000 feet with cumulonimbus clouds. Becoming between
0800Z and 1000Z wind from 320° at 7 knots end of report (=).

**_Area Forecasts (FA)_**

19409
The aviation area forecast (FA) gives a picture of clouds, general weather conditions, and visual meteorological conditions
(VMC) expected over a large area encompassing several states. There are six areas for which area forecasts are published
in the contiguous 48 states. Area forecasts are issued three times a day and are valid for 18 hours. This type of forecast
gives information vital to en route operations as well as forecast information for smaller airports that do not have terminal
forecasts.

**_In-flight Weather Advisories_**

19410
In-flight weather advisories are forecasts provided to en route aircraft, and detail potentially hazardous weather. These
advisories are also available to pilots prior to departure for flight planning purposes.

**_Airman’s Meteorological Information (AIRMET)_**

19411
AIRMETs (report type designator WA) are issued every 6 hours with intermediate updates issued as needed for a particular
area forecast region. The information contained in an AIRMET is of operational interest to all aircraft, but the weather
section concerns phenomena considered potentially hazardous to light aircraft and aircraft with limited operational
capabilities. An AIRMET includes forecast of moderate icing, moderate turbulence, sustained surface winds of 30
knots or greater, widespread areas of ceilings less than 1,000 feet and/or visibilities less than 3 miles, and extensive
mountain obscurities. Each AIRMET bulletin has a fixed alphanumeric designator, and is numbered sequentially for easy
identification, beginning with the first issuance of the day. SIERRA is the AIRMET code used to denote IFR and mountain
obscuration; TANGO is used to denote turbulence, strong surface winds, and low-level wind shear; and ZULU is used to
denote icing and freezing levels.

**_Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET)_**

19414
SIGMETs (report type designator WS) are in-flight advisories concerning nonconvective weather that is potentially
hazardous to all aircraft. They report weather forecasts that include severe icing not associated with thunderstorms, severe
or extreme turbulence or clear air turbulence (CAT) not associated with thunderstorms, dust storms, or sandstorms that
lower surface or in-flight visibilities to below 3 miles, and volcanic ash. SIGMETs are unscheduled forecasts that are valid
for 4 hours, but if the SIGMET relates to hurricanes, it is valid for 6 hours.


-----

A SIGMET is issued under an alphabetic identifier, from November through Yankee, excluding Sierra and Tango. The first
issuance of a SIGMET is designated as a UWS, or Urgent Weather SIGMET. Re-issued SIGMETs for the same weather
phenomenon are sequentially numbered until the weather phenomenon ends.

**_Convective Significant Meteorological Information (WST)_**

9920
A Convective SIGMET (WST) is an in-flight weather advisory issued for hazardous convective weather that affects
the safety of every flight. Convective SIGMETs are issued for severe thunderstorms with surface winds greater than 50
knots, hail at the surface greater than or equal to ¾ inch in diameter, or tornadoes. They are also issued to advise pilots
of embedded thunderstorms, lines of thunderstorms, or thunderstorms with heavy or greater precipitation that affect 40
percent or more of a 3,000 square mile or greater region.

9921
Convective SIGMETs are issued for each area of the contiguous 48 states but not Alaska or Hawaii. Convective SIGMETs
are issued for the eastern (E), western (W), and central (C) United States. Each report is issued at 55 minutes past the hour,
but special Convective SIGMETs can be issued during the interim for any reason. Each forecast is valid for 2 hours. They
are numbered sequentially each day from 1–99, beginning at 00Z. If no hazardous weather exists, the convective SIGMET
is still issued; however, it states “CONVECTIVE SIGMET…NONE.”

KT THRU 2055Z HAIL TO 2 IN PSBL

**_Pilot Weather Reports (PIREPs)_**

19422
Pilot weather reports (PIREPs) provide valuable information regarding the conditions as they actually exist in the air, and
cannot be gathered from any other source. Pilots can confirm the height of bases and tops of clouds, locations of wind shear
and turbulence, and the location of in-flight icing. If the ceiling is below 5,000 feet, or visibility is at or below 5 miles,
ATC facilities are required to solicit PIREPs from pilots in the area. When unexpected weather conditions are encountered,
pilots are encouraged to make a report to an FSS or ATC. When a pilot weather report is filed, the ATC facility or FSS will
add it to the distribution system to brief other pilots and provide in-flight advisories.

19423
PIREPs are easy to file, and a standard reporting form outlines the manner in which they should be filed. Figure 11-4 shows
the elements of a PIREP form. Item numbers 1 through 5 are required information when making a report, as well as at least
one weather phenomenon encountered. PIREPs are normally transmitted as an individual report, but may be appended to a
surface report. Pilot reports are easily decoded and most contractions used in the reports are self-explanatory.

**Chapter Summary**

19439
A thorough understanding of the weather is a “make or break” item for the balloon pilot; without a complete picture of the
weather, a pilot may make an ill-advised decision to launch that may result in injury, damage to the balloon, or worse. It is
imperative that a pilot use as many resources as he can, understanding the variables potentially affecting flight, and making
an informed decision to conduct a safe flight.

19440
Perhaps the most valuable point to be made is that the balloon pilot must use and exercise common sense. When flying
a balloon, the most desirable conditions are good visibility, light winds, and no precipitation. Anything other than that
scenario should be reason to pause and consider the possible outcome of a launch. There is never an absolute requirement
to fly—there is always the possibility of making the decision to try again another day.
