# Chapter 10: The Instructional Process

**Introduction**

20069
As previously discussed in Chapter 1, commercially rated balloon pilots have the additional responsibility and privilege
of providing instruction to aspiring student pilots, without the benefit of having a certified flight instructor (CFI) rating.
This is unique to balloon pilots, as all other aircraft pilots require instruction by a CFI in order to achieve their certificate.

20070
Flight training, whether in an airplane, helicopter, or a balloon, should be conducted in a complete and thorough manner
in order to prepare the student pilot to safely conduct flight operations throughout the entire spectrum of scenarios. An illprepared instructor can produce only an ill-prepared student. A well-prepared instructor produces a well-prepared student,
and they reap the additional benefit of showing the student how instruction should be conducted. That pilot, in later stages,
reflects on their own training and probably conducts future training in the same manner.

20071
The flight instructor is the central figure in aviation training and is responsible for all phases of required training. The
instructor must be fully qualified as an aviation professional; however, the instructor’s ability must go far beyond this if
the requirements of professionalism are to be met. Although the word “professionalism” is widely used, it is rarely defined.
In fact, no single definition can encompass all of the qualifications and considerations that must be present before true
professionalism can exist.

20072
When discussing professionalism, most conversations omit any reference to the accountability of the instructor. An
individual who takes on the responsibility of providing flight instruction must realize that they have a significant influence
on the habits and actions of the student as a pilot. All of the student’s impressions and perceptions towards the flight
experience, balloon operations, and, most importantly, safety is drawn from the instructor’s methods. It becomes imperative
that the instructor understand that they, by default, actively and passively contribute to the future actions of the student
and should make every effort to provide the most thorough training experience possible. It can be said that many students
become “clones” of their instructor.

20073
Though not all inclusive, the following list gives some major considerations and qualifications that should be included in
the definition of professionalism.

20074

-  Professionalism exists only when a service is performed for someone or for the common good.

20075

-  Professionalism is achieved only after extended training and preparation.

20076

-  True performance as a professional is based on study and research.

20077

-  Professionalism requires the ability to make good judgment decisions. Professionals cannot limit their actions and

decisions to standard patterns and practices.

20078

-  Professionalism demands a code of ethics. Professionals must be true to themselves and to those they serve. Anything

less than a sincere performance is quickly detected by the student and immediately destroys instructor effectiveness.

20079

-  Professionalism requires that the individual instructor be able to conduct a self-assessment. A true professional

must be able to critique their own performance with objectivity.

20080
Flight instructors should carefully consider this list. Failing to meet these qualities may result in poor performance by both
instructor and student. Preparation and performance as an instructor with these qualities in mind commands recognition as
a professional in aviation instruction. Professionalism includes an instructor’s public image.

20081
A more complete discussion of the information contained in this chapter may be found in FAA-H-8083-9, Aviation
Instructor’s Handbook. There have been some minor changes in this chapter to address the specific aspects of balloon


-----

flight training. For expanded discussions of the areas of operation covered in the Commercial Pilot Practical Test Standards
(PTS), (FAA-S-8081-18), the Aviation Instructor’s Handbook is required reading. Commercial pilots who wish to excel
at the instruction process may consider taking the Fundamentals of Instruction knowledge test administered through
the FAA’s knowledge testing program. While not a mandatory requirement, it is believed that the study necessary to
successfully complete this exam assists the pilot/instructor in acquiring the knowledge necessary to plan and perform
proper aviation training.

20082
For the remainder of this chapter, it should be understood that the term “flight instructor” is meant to define those individuals
who hold a commercial pilot certificate with a free balloon category rating. This chapter also makes the presupposition that
virtually all balloon flight training is performed “one on one,” and not as part of a group environment.

**Flight Instructor Characteristics & Responsibilities**

20083
Students look to flight instructors as authorities in their respective areas. It is important that flight instructors not only know
how to teach, but they also need to project a knowledgeable and professional image. In addition, flight instructors are on
the front lines of efforts to improve the safety record of the industry. This section addresses the scope of responsibilities for
flight instructors and enumerates methods they can use to enhance their professional image and conduct.

20146
Negative motivation may engender fear, and be perceived by the student as a threat. While negative motivation may be
useful in certain situations, characteristically it is not as effective in promoting efficient learning as positive motivation.

**Instructor Responsibilities**

20084
The job of a flight instructor, or any instructor, is to teach. The learning process can be made easier by helping students
learn, providing adequate instruction, demanding adequate standards of performance, and emphasizing the positive.

**_Helping Students Learn_**

20086
Learning should be an enjoyable experience. By making each lesson a pleasurable experience for the student, the instructor
can maintain a high level of student motivation. This does not mean the instructor must make things easy for the student
or sacrifice standards of performance to please the student. The student experiences satisfaction from doing a good job or
from successfully meeting the challenge of a difficult task.


-----

Learning should be interesting. Knowing the objectives, in clear and concise terms, of each period of instruction gives
meaning and interest to the student, as well as the instructor. Not knowing the objective of the lesson often leads to
confusion, disinterest, and uneasiness on the part of the student.

20088
Learning to fly should be a habit-building period during which the student devotes their attention, memory, and judgment
to the development of correct habits. Any objective other than to learn the right way is likely to make students impatient.
The instructor should keep the students focused on good habits both by example and by a logical presentation of learning
tasks.

**_Providing Adequate Instruction_**

20089
The flight instructor should attempt to carefully and correctly analyze the student’s personality, thinking, and ability. No
two students are alike, and no one method of instruction can be equally effective for each student. The instructor must talk
with a student at some length to learn about the student’s background interests, temperament, and way of thinking. The
instructor’s methods also may change as the student advances through successive stages of training.

20090
An instructor who has not correctly analyzed a student may soon find that the instruction is not producing the desired
results. For example, this could mean that the instructor does not realize that a student is actually a quick thinker, but is
hesitant to act. Such a student may fail to act at the proper time due to lack of self-confidence, even though the situation
is correctly understood. In this case, instruction would obviously be directed toward developing student self-confidence,
rather than drill on flight fundamentals. In another case, too much criticism may completely subdue a timid person, whereas
brisk instruction may force a more diligent application to the learning task. A student may require instructional methods
that combine tact, keen perception, and delicate handling. If such a student receives too much help and encouragement, a
feeling of incompetence may develop.

**_Standards of Performance_**

20091
Flight instructors must continuously evaluate their own effectiveness and the standard of learning and performance achieved
by their students. The desire to maintain pleasant personal relationships with the students must not cause the acceptance
of a slow rate of learning or substandard flight performance. It is a fallacy to believe that accepting lower standards to
please a student produces a genuine improvement in the student-instructor relationship. An earnest student does not resent
reasonable standards that are fairly and consistently applied.

**_Emphasizing the Positive_**

20092
Flight instructors have a tremendous influence on their students’ perception of aviation. The way instructors conduct
themselves, the attitudes they display, and the manner in which they develop their instruction all contribute to the formation
of either positive or negative impressions by their student. The success of a flight instructor depends, in large measure, on
the ability to present instruction so that a student develops a positive image of aviation.

20093
Most new instructors tend to adopt those teaching methods used by their own instructors. These methods may or may not
have been good. The fact that one has learned under one system of instruction does not mean that this is necessarily the
best way it can be done, regardless of the respect one retains for the ability of their original instructor. Some students learn
in spite of their instruction, rather than because of it. Emphasize the positive because positive instruction results in positive
learning.

**Flight Instructor Responsibilities**

20094
All flight instructors shoulder an enormous responsibility because their students ultimately fly an aircraft. Flight instructors
have some additional responsibilities including the responsibility of evaluating student pilots and making a determination of
when they are ready to solo. Other flight instructor responsibilities are based on Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations
(14 CFR) part 61 and advisory circulars (ACs). [ _Figure 10-2_ ]

**_Evaluation of Student Piloting Ability_**

20096
Evaluation is one of the most important elements of instruction. In flight instruction, the instructor initially determines
that the student understands the procedure or maneuver. Then the instructor demonstrates the maneuver, allows the student
to practice the maneuver under direction, and finally evaluates student accomplishment by observing their performance.

20097
Evaluation of demonstrated ability during flight instruction must be based upon established standards of performance,
suitably modified to apply to the student’s experience and stage of development as a pilot. The evaluation must consider
the student’s mastery of all the elements involved in the maneuver, rather than merely the overall performance.

20098
Correction of student errors should not include the practice of taking the controls away from students immediately when
a mistake is made. Safety permitting, it is frequently better to let students progress part of the way into the mistake and
find their own way out. It is difficult for students to learn to do a maneuver properly if they seldom have the opportunity to
correct an error. On the other hand, students may perform a procedure or maneuver correctly and not fully understand the
principles and objectives involved. When the instructor suspects this, students should be required to vary the performance
of the maneuver slightly, combine it with other operations, or apply the same elements to the performance of other
maneuvers. Students who do not understand the principles involved probably are not able to do this successfully.

**_Student Pilot Supervision_**

20099
Flight instructors have the responsibility to provide guidance and restraint with respect to the solo operations of their
students. This is by far the most important flight instructor responsibility because the instructor is the only person in a
position to make the determination that a student is ready for solo operations. Before endorsing a student for solo flight,
the instructor should require the student to demonstrate consistent ability to perform all of the fundamental maneuvers.

**_Practical Test Recommendations_**

20100
Provisions are made on the airman certificate or rating application form for the written recommendation of the flight
instructor who has prepared the applicant for the practical test involved. Signing this recommendation imposes a serious
responsibility on the flight instructor. A flight instructor who makes a practical test recommendation for an applicant
seeking a certificate or rating should require the applicant to thoroughly demonstrate the knowledge and skill level required
for that certificate or rating. This demonstration should in no instance be less than the complete procedure prescribed in
the applicable PTS.


-----

A practical test recommendation based on anything less risks the presentation of an applicant who may be unprepared for
some part of the actual practical test. In such an event, the flight instructor is logically held accountable for a deficient
instructional performance. This risk is especially great in signing recommendations for applicants who have not been
trained by the instructor involved. For balloons, 14 CFR part 61 requires a minimum of two training flights of one hour
each with an authorized instructor within 60 days preceding the date of the test for a private or commercial certificate. The
instructor signing the endorsement is required to have conducted the training in the applicable areas of operation stated
in the regulations and the PTS, and certifies that the person is prepared for the required practical test. In most cases, the
conscientious instructor has little doubt concerning the applicant’s readiness for the practical test.

20102
FAA inspectors and designated pilot examiners rely on flight instructor recommendations as evidence of qualification for
certification, and proof that a review has been given of the subject areas found to be deficient on the appropriate knowledge
test. Recommendations also provide assurance that the applicant has had a thorough briefing on the practical test standards
and the associated knowledge areas, maneuvers, and procedures. If the flight instructor has trained and prepared the
applicant competently, the applicant should have no problem passing the practical test.

20103
The recommended format for log book endorsements may be found in the current version of AC 61-65; an extract of those
relevant to balloon instruction may be found in Appendix E.

**_Self-Improvement_**

20104
Professional flight instructors must never become complacent or satisfied with their own qualifications and abilities.
They should be constantly alert for ways to improve their qualifications, effectiveness, and the services they provide to
students. Flight instructors are considered authorities on aeronautical matters and are the experts to whom many pilots refer
questions concerning regulations, requirements, and new operating techniques.

**_Sincerity_**

20105
The professional instructor should be straightforward and honest. Attempting to hide some inadequacy behind a
smokescreen of unrelated instruction makes it impossible for the instructor to command the respect and full attention of a
student. Teaching an aviation student is based upon acceptance of the instructor as a competent, qualified teacher and an
expert pilot. Any facade of instructor pretentiousness, whether it is real or mistakenly assumed by the student, immediately
causes the student to lose confidence in the instructor and learning is adversely affected.

**_Acceptance of the Student_**

20106
With regard to students, the instructor must accept them as they are, including all their faults and problems. The student
is a person who wants to learn, and the instructor is a person who is available to help in the learning process. Beginning
with this understanding, the professional relationship of the instructor with the student should be based on a mutual
acknowledgement that the student and the instructor are important to each other, and that both are working toward the
same objective.

**_Personal Appearance and Habits_**

20107
Personal appearance has an important effect on the professional image of the instructor. Today’s aviation customers expect
their instructors to be neat, clean, and appropriately dressed. Since the instructor is engaged in a learning situation, the
attire worn should be appropriate to a professional status. [ _Figure 10-3_ ]


-----

**Figure 10-3.** _The flight instructor should always present a professional appearance._

20109
Personal habits have a significant effect on the professional image. The exercise of common courtesy is perhaps the most
important of these.

**_Demeanor_**

20110
The attitude and behavior of the instructor can contribute much to a professional image. The professional image requires
development of a calm, thoughtful, and disciplined, but not somber, demeanor.

20111
The instructor should also present an attitude of enthusiasm, with respect to the training conducted, whether ground or
flight. The enthusiasm expressed by the instructor is normally reflected in the student’s response to the training, and makes
it a much more enjoyable experience for all parties concerned.

**_Safety Practices and Accident Prevention_**

20112
The safety practices emphasized by instructors have a long lasting effect on students. Generally, students consider their
instructor to be a model of perfection whose habits they attempt to imitate, whether consciously or unconsciously. The
instructor’s advocacy and description of safety practices mean little to a student if the instructor does not demonstrate
them consistently. For this reason, instructors must meticulously observe the safety practices being taught to students. A
good example is the use of a checklist before takeoff. If a student pilot sees the flight instructor layout, inflate, and take
off in a balloon without referring to a checklist, no amount of instruction in the use of a checklist convinces that student to
faithfully use one when solo flight operations begin.

20113
To maintain a professional image, a flight instructor must carefully observe all regulations and recognized safety practices
during flight operations. An instructor who is observed to fly with apparent disregard for loading limitations or weather
minimums creates an image of irresponsibility that many hours of scrupulous flight instruction can never correct.
Habitual observance of regulations, safety precautions, and the precepts of courtesy enhances the instructor’s image of
professionalism. Moreover, such habits make the instructor more effective by encouraging students to develop similar
habits.

**_Proper Language_**

20114
In aviation instruction, as in other professional activities, the use of profanity and obscene language leads to distrust or, at
best, to a lack of complete confidence in the instructor. To many people, such language is actually objectionable to the point
of being painful. The professional instructor must speak normally, without inhibitions, and develop the ability to speak
positively and descriptively without excesses of language.

20115
Also consider that the beginning aviation student is being introduced to new concepts and experiences and encountering
new terms and phrases that are often confusing. At the beginning of the student’s training, and before each lesson during
early instruction, the instructor should carefully define the terms and phrases to be used during the lesson. The instructor


-----

should then be careful to limit instruction to those terms and phrases, unless the exact meaning and intent of any new
expression are explained immediately. In all cases, terminology should be explained to the student before it is used during
instruction.

**The Learning Process**

20116
To learn is to acquire knowledge or skill. Learning also may involve a change in attitude or behavior. Pilots need to acquire
the higher levels of knowledge and skill, including the ability to exercise judgment and solve problems. The challenge for
the flight instructor is to understand how people learn, and more importantly, to be able to apply that knowledge to the
learning environment. [ _Figure 10-4_ ]

**Figure 10-4.** _Effective learning shares several common characteristics._

**Definition of Learning**

20118
The ability to learn is one of the most outstanding human characteristics. Learning occurs continuously throughout a
person’s lifetime. To define learning, it is necessary to analyze what happens to the individual. Thus, learning can be
defined as a change in behavior as a result of experience. This can be physical and overt, or it may involve complex
intellectual or attitudinal changes which affect behavior in more subtle ways. In spite of numerous theories and contrasting
views, psychologists generally agree on many common characteristics of learning.

**Characteristics of Learning**

20119
Flight instructors need a good understanding of the general characteristics of learning in order to apply them in a learning
situation. If learning is a change in behavior as a result of experience, then instruction must include a careful and systematic
creation of those experiences that promote learning. This process can be quite complex because, among other things, an
individual’s background strongly influences the way that person learns. To be effective, the learning situation should
contain the following four points:

20120

1. Learning is purposeful. Most people have definite ideas about what they want to do and achieve. Their goals are
sometimes short term, involving a matter of days or weeks, while others may have goals carefully planned for a
career or a lifetime. Each student, then, has specific intentions and goals. Learning, then, becomes a means to those
goals.

20121

2. Learning is a result of experience. A student can learn only from personal experience; therefore learning and
knowledge cannot exist apart from a person. Even when observing or performing the same procedures, two people
can react differently; they learn different things from it, according to the manner in which the event affects their
individual needs.

20122

3. Learning is multifaceted. The learning process includes verbal elements, emotional elements, and problem-solving
elements all taking place at once.


-----

4. Learning is an active process. The individual who wishes to be proficient at a particular task or skill should
understand that they never stop learning.

**Principles of Learning**

20124

-  Over the years, educational psychologists have identified several principles which seem generally applicable to the

learning process. They provide additional insight into what makes people learn most effectively.

20125

-  Readiness—individuals learn best when they are ready to learn. However, they do not learn well if they see no

reason for learning. Getting students ready to learn is usually the instructor’s responsibility. If students have a strong
purpose, a clear objective, and a definite reason for learning something, they make more progress than if they lack
motivation.

20126

-  Exercise—the principle of exercise states that those things most often repeated are best remembered. It is the basis

of drill and practice. The human memory is fallible. The mind can rarely retain, evaluate, and apply new concepts
or practices after a single exposure. Students learn by applying what they have been told and shown. Every time
practice occurs, learning continues. The instructor must provide opportunities for students to practice and, at the
same time, make sure that this process is directed toward a goal.

20127

-  Effect—based on the emotional reaction of the student. It states that learning is strengthened when accompanied

by a pleasant or satisfying feeling, and that learning is weakened when associated with an unpleasant feeling.
Experiences that produce feelings of defeat, frustration, anger, confusion, or futility are unpleasant for the student.
If, for example, an instructor attempts to teach precision maneuvering during the first flight, the student is likely to
feel inferior and be frustrated.

20128

-  Primacy—the state of being first, often creates a strong, almost unshakable, impression. For the instructor, this means

that what is taught must be right the first time. For the student, it means that learning must be right. “Unteaching”
is often more difficult than teaching. Every student should be started right. The first experience should be positive,
functional, and lay the foundation for all that is to follow.

20129

-  Intensity—a vivid, dramatic, or exciting learning experience teaches more than a routine or boring experience. A

student is likely to gain greater understanding of steep approaches or short-field, high wind landings by performing
them rather than merely reading about them. The principle of intensity implies that a student learns more from the
real thing than from a substitute.

20130

-  Recency—things most recently learned are best remembered. Conversely, the further a student is removed in time

from a new factor in understanding, the more difficult it is to remember. Instructors recognize the principle of
recency when they carefully plan a summary for a ground school lesson, a flight period, or a postflight critique.

**How People Learn**

20131
Initially, all learning comes from perceptions which are directed to the brain by one or more of the five senses: sight,
hearing, touch, smell, and taste. Psychologists have also found that learning occurs most rapidly when information is
received through more than one of the senses. [ _Figure 10-5_ ]

**Figure 10-5.** _Most learning occurs through sight, but the combination of sight and hearing accounts for about 99 percent of all_

_perception._

**_Perceptions_**

20133
Perceiving involves more than the reception of stimuli from the five senses. Perceptions result when a person gives meaning
to sensations. People base their actions on the way they believe things to be.

20134
Real meaning comes only from within a person, even though the perceptions which evoke these meanings result from
external stimuli. The meanings which are derived from perceptions are influenced not only by the individual’s experience,
but also by many other factors. Knowledge of the factors which affect the perceptual process is very important to the flight
instructor because perceptions are the basis of all learning.

**_Factions Which Affect Perception_**

20135
There are several factors that affect an individual’s ability to perceive. Some are internal to each person and some are
external.

20136

-  Physical organism—provides individuals with the perceptual sensors for perceiving the world around them.

20137

-  Basic need—a person’s basic need is to maintain and enhance the organized self. A person’s most pressing need is

to preserve and perpetuate the self. To that end, an instructor must remember that anything asked of the student that
may be interpreted by the student as endangering the self is resisted or denied.

20138

-  Goals and values—perceptions depend on one’s goals and values. The precise kinds of commitments and

philosophical outlooks which the student holds are important for the instructor to know, since this knowledge assists
in predicting how the student interprets experiences and instructions.

20139

-  Self-concept—a powerful determinant in learning. If a student’s experiences tend to support a favorable self-image,

the student tends to remain receptive to subsequent experiences. A negative self-concept inhibits the perceptual
processes which tend to keep the student from perceiving, effectively blocking the learning process.

20140

-  Time and opportunity—it takes time and opportunity to perceive. Learning some things depends on other perceptions

which have preceded these learnings, and on the availability of time to sense and relate these new things to the
earlier perceptions. Thus, sequence and time are necessary.


-----

-  Element of threat—does not promote effective learning. When confronted with a perceived threat, students tent to

limit their attention to the threatening object or condition.

**_Insight_**

20142
Insight involves the grouping of perceptions into meaningful groups of understanding. Creating insight is one of the
instructor’s major responsibilities. To ensure that this does occur, it is essential to keep each student constantly receptive
to new experiences and to help the student realize the way each piece relates to all other pieces of the total pattern of the
task to be learned.

20143
As perceptions increase in number and are assembled by the student into larger blocks of learning, they develop insight.
As a result, learning becomes more meaningful and more permanent. Forgetting is less of a problem when there are more
anchor points for tying insights together. It is a major responsibility of the instructor to organize demonstrations and
explanations, and to direct practice, so that the student has better opportunities to understand the interrelationship of the
many kinds of experiences that have been perceived. Pointing out the relationships as they occur, providing a secure and
nonthreatening environment in which to learn, and helping the student acquire and maintain a favorable self-concept are
key steps in fostering the development of insight.

**_Motivation_**

20144
Motivation is probably the dominant force governing the student’s progress and ability to learn. Motivation may be positive
or negative, tangible or intangible, subtle and difficult to identify, or it may be obvious.

20145
Positive motivation is provided by the promise or achievement of rewards. These rewards may be personal or social;
they may involve financial gain, satisfaction of the self-concept, or public recognition. Motivation which can be used to
advantage by the instructor includes the desire for personal gain, the desire for personal comfort or security, the desire for
group approval, and the achievement of a favorable self-image.

20147
Positive motivation is essential to true learning. Negative motivation in the form of reproofs or threats should be avoided
with all but the most overconfident and impulsive students. Slumps in learning are often due to declining motivation.
Motivation does not remain at a uniformly high level. It may be affected by outside influences, such as physical or mental
disturbances or inadequate instruction. The instructor should strive to maintain motivation at the highest possible level. In
addition, the instructor should be alert to detect and counter any lapses in motivation.

**Levels of Learning**

20148
Levels of learning may be classified in any number of ways. Four basic levels have traditionally been included in flight
instructor training:

20149

-  Rote—the ability to repeat something back which was learned but not understood. An example of this may be the

student who reads and can repeat back the applicable provision of 14 CFR part 91, section 91.119, Minimum Safe
Altitudes, but has no concept of how this may affect their flight.

20150

-  Understanding—to comprehend or grasp the nature or meaning of something. Once a student has received proper

instruction on performing a steep descent, and has some experience controlling the balloon in straight and level
flight, he can consolidate those old and new perceptions into an insight on how to make a steep approach. At this
point, the student has developed an understanding of the procedure for the steep approach.

20151

-  Application—the act of putting something to use that has been learned and understood. When the student understands

the procedure for entering and performing a steep approach to the ground, has had the maneuver demonstrated, and
has practiced the approach until consistency has been achieved, the student has developed the skill to apply what has
been learned. This is a major level of learning, and one at which the instructor is too often willing to stop.


-----

-  Correlation—associating what has been learned, understood, and applied with previous or subsequent learning. The

correlation level of learning, which should be the objective of aviation instruction, is that level at which the student
becomes able to associate an element which has been learned with other segments or blocks or learning.

20153
Most training is conducted in such a manner that the student never progresses past the rote and understanding levels. This
is an unacceptable procedure, as practical testing requires the student to perform at the application and correlation levels.
Failing to bring the student to those levels is incomplete instruction, and does not provide a complete training experience.

**Transfer of Learning**

20154
During a learning experience, the student may be aided by things learned previously. On the other hand, it is sometimes
apparent that previous learning interferes with the current learning task. Consider the learning of two skills. If the learning
of skill A helps to learn skill B, positive transfer occurs. If learning skill A hinders the learning of skill B, negative transfer
occurs. It should be noted that the learning of skill B may affect the retention or proficiency of skill A, either positively or
negatively. While these processes may help substantiate the interference theory of forgetting, they are still concerned with
the transfer of learning.

20155
Many aspects of teaching profit by this type of transfer. It may explain why students of apparently equal ability have
differing success in certain areas. Negative transfer may hinder the learning of some; positive transfer may help others.
This points to a need to know a student’s past experience and what has already been learned. In lesson and syllabus
development, instructors should plan for transfer of learning by organizing course materials and individual lesson materials
in a meaningful sequence. Each phase should help the student learn what is to follow.

**Habit Formation**

20156
The formation of correct habits from the beginning of any learning process is essential to further learning and for correct
performance after the completion of training. Remember that primacy is one of the fundamental principles of learning.
Therefore, it is the instructor’s responsibility to insist on correct techniques and procedures from the outset of training to
provide proper habit patterns. It is much easier to foster proper habits from the beginning of training than to correct faulty
ones later.

20157
Due to the high level of knowledge and skill required in aviation for pilots, training has traditionally followed a building
block concept. This means new learning and habits are based on a solid foundation of experience and/or old learning. As
knowledge and skill increase, there is an expanding base upon which to build for the future.

**Theories of Forgetting**

20158
A consideration of why people forget may point the way to help them remember. Several theories account for forgetting,
including disuse and interference.

**_Disuse_**

20159
The theory of disuse suggests that a person forgets those things which are not used. The high school or college graduate
is saddened by the lack of factual data retained several years after graduation. Since the things which are remembered
are those used on the job, a person concludes that forgetting is the result of disuse. But the explanation is not quite so
simple. Experimental studies show that a hypnotized person can describe specific details of an event which normally is
beyond recall. Apparently the memory is there, locked in the recesses of the mind. The difficulty is summoning it up to
consciousness.

**_Interference_**

20160
The basis of the interference theory is that people forget something because a certain experience has overshadowed it, or
that the learning of similar things has intervened. This theory might explain how the range of experiences after graduation
from school causes a person to forget or to lose knowledge. In other words, new events displace many things that had been


-----

learned. From experiments, at least two conclusions about interference may be drawn. First, similar material seems to
interfere with memory more than dissimilar material; and second, material not well learned suffers most from interference.

**The Teaching Process**

20161
Effective teaching is based on principles of learning which have been previously discussed in this chapter. The learning
process is not easily separated into a definite number of steps. Sometimes, learning occurs almost instantaneously, and
other times it is acquired only through long, patient study and diligent practice. The teaching process, on the other hand,
can be divided into steps. Although there is disagreement about the number of steps, examination of the various lists
of steps in the teaching process reveals that different authors are saying essentially the same thing: the teaching of new
material can be reduced to preparation, presentation, application, and review and evaluation. [ _Figure 10-6_ ]

20162

**Figure 10-6.** _The teaching process consists of four basic principles._

20163
When beginning the teaching process, it may be helpful if the instructor remembers that in order to provide a “holistic,” or
complete, approach to aviation training, it is necessary to teach more than just the “how-to” of flying. Too many times, the
entire focus of flight training is spent on the mechanical aspects of performing a maneuver; it may be a better approach to
also include and discuss the “why” of an action, to assist the student in gaining a better understanding of the flight process.

**Preparation**

20164
For each lesson or instructional period, the instructor must prepare a lesson plan. Traditionally, this plan includes a statement
of lesson objectives, the procedures and facilities to be used during the lesson, the specific goals to be attained, and the
means to be used for review and evaluation. The lesson plan should also include home study or other special preparation
to be done by the student. The instructor should make certain that all necessary supplies, materials, and equipment needed
for the lesson are readily available and that the equipment is operating properly. Preparation of the lesson plan may be
accomplished after reference to the syllabus or practical test standards (PTS), or it may be in a preprinted form as prepared
by a publisher of training materials. These documents list general objectives that are to be accomplished. Objectives are
needed to bring the unit of instruction into focus. The instructor can organize the overall instructional plan by writing down
the objectives and making certain that they flow in a logical sequence from beginning to end. The objectives allow the
instructor to structure the training and permit the student to see clearly what is required along the way.

**_Performance-Based Objectives_**

20165
One good way to write lesson plans is to begin by formulating performance-based objectives. The instructor uses the
objectives as listed in the syllabus or the appropriate PTS or ACS as the beginning point for establishing performance-


-----

based objectives. These objectives are very helpful in delineating exactly what needs to be done and how it is done
during each lesson. Once the performance-based objectives are written, most of the work of writing a final lesson plan is
completed. One useful thought is the utilization of the “DAM principle”; objectives, as well as goals, should be difficult,
attainable, and measurable.

20166
Performance-based objectives are used to set measurable, reasonable standards that describe the desired performance of the
student. This usually involves the term behavioral objective, although it may be referred to as a performance, instructional,
or educational objective. All refer to the same thing, the behavior of the student.

20167
Performance-based objectives consist of three parts: description of the skill or behavior, conditions, and criteria. Each part
is required and must be stated in a way that leaves every reader with the same picture of the objective, how it is performed,
and to what level of performance. [ _Figure 10-7_ ]

20168


**Figure 10-7.** _Performance-based objectives are made up of a description of the skill or behavior, conditions, and criteria._

20169
Use of performance-based objectives also provides the student with a better understanding of the big picture, as well as
knowledge of exactly what is expected. This overview can alleviate a significant source of frustration on the part of the
student.

**Presentation**

20170
Instructors have several methods of presentation from which to choose. The nature of the subject matter and the objective
in teaching it normally determine the method of presentation.

20171
The lecture method is suitable for presenting new material, for summarizing ideas, and for showing relationships between
theory and practice. For example, it is suitable for the presentation of a ground school lesson on performance planning.
This method is most effective when accompanied by instructional aids and training devices. In the case of a discussion on
performance planning, a chalkboard, a marker board, or flip chart could be used effectively.

20172
The demonstration-performance method is desirable for teaching a skill, such as instruction on most flight maneuvers.
Showing a student pilot how to perform a steep descent, for example, would be appropriate for this method. The instructor
would first demonstrate the maneuver, and then have the student attempt the same maneuver.


-----

Another form of presentation is the guided discussion which is used in a classroom situation. It is a good method for
encouraging active participation of the students. It is especially helpful in teaching subjects such as safety and emergency
procedures where students can use initiative and imagination in addressing problem areas.

**Review & Application**

20174
Application is where the student uses what the instructor has presented. After a classroom presentation, the student may be
asked to explain the new material. The student also may be asked to perform a procedure or operation that has just been
demonstrated. In most instructional situations, the instructor’s explanation and demonstration activities are alternated with
student performance efforts. The instructor makes a presentation and then asks the student to try the same procedure or
operation.

20175
Usually the instructor has to interrupt the student’s efforts for corrections and further demonstrations. This is necessary,
because it is very important that each student perform the maneuver or operation the right way the first few times. This
is when habits are established. Faulty habits are difficult to correct and must be addressed as soon as possible. Flight
instructors in particular must be aware of this problem since students do a lot of their practice without an instructor. Only
after reasonable competence has been demonstrated should the student be allowed to practice certain maneuvers on solo
flights. Then, the student can practice the maneuver again and again until correct performance becomes almost automatic.
Periodic review and evaluation by the instructor is necessary to ensure that the student has not acquired any bad habits.

**Teaching Methods**

20176
The information presented in previous sections has been largely theoretical, emphasizing concepts and principles pertinent
to the learning process, human behavior, and effective communication in education and training programs. This knowledge,
if properly used, enables instructors to be more confident, efficient, and successful. The discussion which follows departs
from the theoretical with some specific recommendations for the actual conduct of the teaching process. Included are
methods and procedures which have been tested and found to be effective.

20177
Personal computers are a part of every segment of our society today. Since a number of computer-based programs are
currently available from publishers of aviation training materials, a brief description of new technologies and how to use
them effectively is provided near the end of this section.

**Organizing Material**

20178
Regardless of the teaching method used, an instructor must properly organize the material. Lessons do not stand alone
within a course of training. There must be a plan of action to lead instructors and their students through the course in a
logical manner toward the desired goal. Usually the goal for students is a certificate or rating. A systematic plan of action
requires the use of an appropriate training syllabus.

20179
Generally, the syllabus must contain a description of each lesson, including objectives and completion standards.

20180
Although instructors may develop their own syllabus, in practice many instructors use a group-developed syllabus such as
that developed and available through the Balloon Federation of America. Thus, the main concern of the instructor usually
is the more manageable task of organizing a block of training with integrated lesson plans. The traditional organization of
a lesson plan is: introduction, development, and conclusion.

**Introduction**

20181
The introduction sets the stage for everything to come. Efforts in this area pay great dividends in terms of quality of
instruction. In brief, the introduction is made up of three elements—attention, motivation, and an overview of what is to
be covered. [ _Figure 10-8_ ]


-----

**Introduction**

**Element                 Purpose**

**Attention** -  Establish common ground between instructor
and student

-  Capture and hold the attention of the class

-  Specify benefits the student can expect from
the lesson

**Motivation** -  Establish receptive attitude toward lesson

-  Create smooth transition into lesson

**Overview** -  Indicate what is to be covered and relate this
information to the overall course

**Figure 10-8.** _The introduction prepares the students to receive the information in the lesson._

**_Attention_**

20183
The purpose of the attention element is to focus each student’s attention on the lesson. The instructor may begin by telling
a story, making an unexpected or surprising statement, asking a question, or telling a joke. Any of these may be appropriate
at one time or another. Regardless of which is used, it should relate to the subject and establish a background for developing
the learning outcomes. Telling a story or a joke that is not related in some way to the subject can only distract from the
lesson. The main concern is to gain the attention of everyone and concentrate on the subject.

**_Motivation_**

20184
The purpose of the motivation element is to offer the student specific reasons why the lesson content is important to know,
understand, apply, or perform. For example, the instructor may talk about an occurrence where the knowledge in the lesson
was applied. Or the instructor may remind the student of an upcoming test on the material. This motivation should appeal
to each student personally and engender a desire to learn the material.

**_Overview_**

20185
Every lesson introduction should contain an overview that explains what is to be covered during the period. A clear, concise
presentation of the objective and the key ideas gives the students a road map of the route to be followed. A good visual aid
can help the instructor show the students the path that they are to travel. The introduction should be free of stories, humor,
or incidents that do not help the students focus their attention on the lesson objective. Also, the instructor should avoid a
long apologetic introduction, because it only serves to dampen the students’ interest in the lesson.

**Development**

20186
Development is the main part of the lesson. Here, the instructor develops the subject matter in a manner that helps the
students achieve the desired learning outcomes. The instructor must logically organize the material to show the relationships
of the main points. The instructor usually shows these primary relationships by developing the main points in one of the
following ways: from past to present, simple to complex, known to unknown, and most frequently used to least frequently
used.

20187
Under each main point in a lesson, the subordinate points should lead naturally from one to the other. With this arrangement,
each point leads logically into, and serves as a reminder of, the next. Meaningful transitions from one main point to another
keep the students oriented, aware of where they have been, and where they are going. This permits effective sorting or
categorizing chunks of information in the working or short-term memory. Organizing a lesson so the students grasp the
logical relationships of ideas is not an easy task, but it is necessary if the students are to learn and remember what they
have learned. Poorly organized information is of little or no value to the student because it cannot be readily understood
or remembered.


-----

**Conclusion**

20188
An effective conclusion retraces the important elements of the lesson and relates them to the objective. This review and
wrap-up of ideas reinforces student learning and improves the retention of what has been learned. New ideas should not be
introduced in the conclusion because at this point they are likely to confuse the students.

20189
By organizing the lesson material into a logical format, the instructor has maximized the opportunity for students to retain
the desired information. However, each teaching situation is unique. The setting and purpose of the lesson determines which
teaching method—lecture, guided discussion, demonstration-performance, cooperative or group learning, computer-based
training, or a combination—is used.

**Lecture Method**

20190
The lecture method is the most widely used form of presentation. Every instructor should know how to develop and present
a lecture. [ _Figure 10-9_ ] Lectures are used for introduction of new subjects, summarizing ideas, showing relationships
between theory and practice, and reemphasizing main points. The lecture method is adaptable to many different settings,
including either small or large groups. Lectures also may be used to introduce a unit of instruction or a complete training
program. Finally, lectures may be combined with other teaching methods to give added meaning and direction.

20191

**Figure 10-9.** _Instructors should try a dry run with another instructor to get a feel for the lecture presentation._

20192
The lecture method of teaching needs to be very flexible since it may be used in different ways. For example, there are
several types of lectures such as the illustrated talk where the speaker relies heavily on visual aids to convey ideas to
the listeners. With a briefing, the speaker presents a concise array of facts to the listeners who normally do not expect
elaboration of supporting material. During a formal lecture, the speaker’s purpose is to inform, to persuade, or to entertain
with little or no verbal participation by the students. When using a teaching lecture, the instructor plans and delivers an oral
presentation in a manner that allows some participation by the students and helps direct them toward the desired learning
outcomes.

**Demonstration-Performance Method**

20193
This method of teaching is based on the simple, yet sound principle that we learn by doing. Students learn physical or
mental skills by actually performing those skills under supervision. An individual learns to write by writing, and to fly a


-----

balloon by actually performing flight maneuvers. Students also learn mental skills, such as speed reading, by this method.
Skills requiring the use of tools, machines, and equipment are particularly well suited to this instructional method.

20194
Every instructor should recognize the importance of student performance in the learning process. Early in a lesson that is to
include demonstration and performance, the instructor should identify the most important learning outcomes. Next, explain
and demonstrate the steps involved in performing the skill being taught. Then, allow students time to practice each step, so
they can increase their ability to perform the skill.

20195
The demonstration-performance method of teaching has five essential phases:

20196

-  Explanation Phase—explanations must be clear, pertinent to the objectives of the particular lesson to be

presented, and based on the known experience and knowledge of the student. In addition to the necessary actions to
be performed, the instructor should describe the end result of these efforts.

20197

-  Demonstration Phase—the instructor must show the student the actions necessary to perform a skill.

20198

-  Student Performance and Instructor Supervision Phases—these two phases, which involve separate actions, are

performed concurrently, and are thus described under a single heading. The first action is the performance by the
student of the physical or mental skill that had been explained. The second is the instructor’s supervision, insuring
that errors are immediately corrected to standards already prescribed.

20199

-  Evaluation Phase—in this final phase, the instructor judges student performance. The student performs whatever

competence has been attained, and the instructor evaluates and discovers just how well the skill has been learned.
Form this measurement of student achievement, the instructor determines the effectiveness of the instruction.

**Computer-based Training**

20200
Many new and innovative training technologies are available today. One of the most significant is computer-based training
(CBT)—the use of the personal computer as a training device. [ _Figure 10-10_ ] CBT is sometimes called computer-based
instruction (CBI). The terms CBT and CBI are synonymous and may be used interchangeably.

20201

**Figure 10-10.** _The instructor must continually monitor student performance when using CBT, as with all instructional aids._

20202
Common examples of CBT with specific application to balloon flight training include the computer versions of the test
prep study guides which are useful for preparation for the FAA knowledge tests. These programs typically allow the


-----

students to select a test, complete the questions, and find out how they did on the test. The student may then conduct a
review of questions missed. An excellent resource for balloon training is the website webexams.com ; this provides the
student with the ability to take practice exams, which assists in determining weaknesses in training.

20203
While computers provide many training advantages, they also have limitations. Improper or excessive use of CBT should
be avoided. Computer-based training should not be used by the instructor as stand-alone training any more than a textbook
or video. Like video or a textbook, CBT is an aid to the instructor. The instructor must be actively involved with the students
when using instructional aids. This involvement should include close supervision, questions, examinations, quizzes, or
guided discussions on the subject matter.

**Techniques of Flight Instruction**

20204
In this section, the demonstration-performance method is applied to the telling-and-doing technique of flight instruction,
as well as the integrated technique of flight instruction.

**The Telling-and-Doing Technique**

20205
This technique has been in use for a long time and is very effective in teaching physical skills. Flight instructors find it
valuable in teaching procedures and maneuvers. The telling-and-doing technique is actually a variation of the demonstrationperformance method. In the telling-and-doing technique, the first step is preparation. This is particularly important in flight
instruction because of the introduction of new maneuvers or procedures. The flight instructor needs to be well prepared
and highly organized if complex maneuvers and procedures are to be taught effectively. The student must be intellectually
and psychologically ready for the learning activity. The preparation step is accomplished prior to the flight lesson with a
discussion of lesson objectives and completion standards, as well as a thorough preflight briefing. [ _Figure 10-11_ ]

_is the important transition, student tells—instructor does, which occurs between the second and third step._

**_Instructor Tells-Instructor Does_**

20207
Presentation is the second step in the teaching process. It is a continuation of preparing the student, which began in
the detailed preflight discussion, and now continues by a carefully planned demonstration and accompanying verbal
explanation of the procedure or maneuver. It is important that the demonstration conforms to the explanation as closely
as possible. In addition, it should be demonstrated in the same sequence in which it was explained to avoid confusion and
provide reinforcement.

**_Student Tells-Instructor Does_**

20208
This is a transition between the second and third steps in the teaching process. It is the most obvious departure from the
demonstration-performance technique, and may provide the most significant advantages. In this step, the student actually
plays the role of instructor, telling the instructor what to do and how to do it. Two benefits accrue from this step. First,


-----

being freed from the need to concentrate on performance of the maneuver and from concern about its outcome, the student
should be able to organize their thoughts regarding the steps involved and the techniques to be used. In the process of
explaining the maneuver as the instructor performs it, perceptions begin to develop into insights. Mental habits begin to
form with repetition of the instructions previously received. Second, with the student doing the talking, the instructor is
able to evaluate the student’s understanding of the factors involved in performance of the maneuver.

**_Student Tells-Student Does_**

20209
Application is the third step in the teaching process. This is where learning takes place and where performance habits
are formed. If the student has been adequately prepared (first step) and the procedure or maneuver fully explained and
demonstrated (second step), meaningful learning occurs. The instructor should be alert during the student’s practice to
detect any errors in technique and to prevent the formation of faulty habits.

20210
At the same time, the student should be encouraged to think about what to do during the performance of a maneuver, until
it becomes habitual. In this step, the thinking is done verbally. This focuses concentration on the task to be accomplished,
so that total involvement in the maneuver is fostered.

**_Student Does-Instructor Evaluates_**

20211
The fourth step of the teaching process is review and evaluation. In this step, the instructor reviews what has been covered
during the instructional flight and determines to what extent the student has met the objectives outlined during the preflight
discussion. Since the student no longer is required to talk through the maneuver during this step, the instructor should be
satisfied that the student is well prepared and understands the task before starting. This last step is identical to the final step
used in the demonstration-performance method. The instructor observes as the student performs, then makes appropriate
comments.

20212
At the conclusion of the evaluation phase, record the student’s performance and verbally advise each student of the
progress made toward the objectives. Regardless of how well a skill is taught, there may still be failures. Since success is a
motivating factor, instructors should be positive in revealing results. When pointing out areas that need improvement, offer
concrete suggestions that help. The instructor should make every effort to end the evaluation on a positive note.

**Critique & Evaluation**

20213
Since every student is different and each learning situation is unique, the actual outcome may not be entirely as expected.
The instructor must be able to appraise student performance and convey this information back to the student. No skill is more
important to an instructor than the ability to analyze, appraise, and judge student performance. The student quite naturally
looks to the instructor for guidance, analysis, appraisal, as well as suggestions for improvement and encouragement. This
feedback from instructor to student is called a critique.

20214
In most cases, a critique should be conducted in private. It should come immediately after a student’s performance, while
the details of the performance are easy to recall. An instructor may critique any activity which a student performs or
practices to improve skill, proficiency, and learning.

20215
Two common misconceptions about the critique should be corrected at the outset. First, a critique is not a step in the
grading process. It is a step in the learning process. Second, a critique is not necessarily negative in content. It considers the
good along with the bad, the individual parts, relationships of the individual parts, and the overall performance. A critique
can, and usually should, be as varied in content as the performance being critiqued.

**Purpose of a Critique**

20216
A critique should provide the student with something constructive upon which they can work or build. It should provide
direction and guidance to raise their level of performance. Students must understand the purpose of the critique; otherwise,
they are unlikely to accept the criticism offered and little improvement will result.


-----

**Methods of Critique**

20217
The critique of student performance is always the instructor’s responsibility, and it can never be delegated in its entirety.
The instructor can add interest and variety to the criticism through the use of imagination and by drawing on the talents,
ideas, and opinions of others. There are several useful methods of conducting a critique, two of which have specific
application to balloon flight instruction.

**Student-Led Critique**

20218
The instructor asks a student to lead the critique. The instructor can specify the pattern of organization and the techniques
or can leave it to the discretion of the student leader. Because of the inexperience of the participants in the lesson area,
student-led critiques may not be efficient, but they can generate student interest and learning and, on the whole, be effective.

**Self-Critique**

20219
A student is required to critique personal performance. Like all other methods, a self-critique must be controlled and
supervised by the instructor. Whatever the methods employed, the instructor must not leave controversial issues unresolved,
nor erroneous impressions uncorrected. The instructor must make allowances for the student’s relative inexperience.
Normally, the instructor should reserve time at the end of the student critique to cover those areas that might have been
omitted, not emphasized sufficiently, or considered worth repeating. One variant of this method is for the instructor to ask
the student to name three negative aspects of the flight training period, and discuss corrective action. Then, the instructor
asks for three positive aspects of the training. This also indicates to the instructor whether or not the student is able to
analyze their performance, in relation to the standards sought.

**Ground Rules for Critiquing**

20220
There are a number of rules and techniques to keep in mind when conducting a critique. The following list can be applied,
regardless of the type of critiquing activity.

20221

-  Avoid trying to cover too much. A few well-made points usually is more beneficial than a large number of points

that are not developed adequately.

20222

-  Allow time for a summary of the critique to reemphasize the most important things a student should remember.

20223

-  Never allow yourself to be maneuvered into the unpleasant position of defending criticism. If the criticism is honest,

objective, constructive, and comprehensive, no defense should be necessary.

20224

-  If part of the critique is written, make certain that it is consistent with the oral portion.

20225
Although, at times, a critique may seem like an evaluation, it is not. Both student and instructor should consider it as an
integral part of the lesson. It normally is a wrap-up of the lesson. A good critique closes the chapter on the lesson and sets
the stage for the next lesson.

**Characteristics of an Effective Critique**

20226
In order to provide direction and raise the students’ level of performance, the critique must be factual and be aligned with
the completion standards of the lesson. This, of course, is because the critique is a part of the learning process. Some of the
requirements for an effective critique are shown in _Figure 10-12_ .


-----

**Objective**

**Specific** **Flexible**


**The**

**Thoughtful** **Effective** **Acceptable**

**Critique**



**Comprehensive**


**Constructive**

**Figure 10-12.** _Elements of an effective critique._

20228
Objective—the effective critique is focused on student performance. It should be objective, and not reflect the personal
opinions, likes, dislikes, and biases of the instructor. If a critique is to be objective, it must be honest; it must be based on
the performance as it was, not as it could have been, or as the instructor and student wished that it had been.

20229
Flexible—the instructor needs to examine the entire performance of a student and the context in which it is accomplished.
Sometimes a good student turns in a poor performance and a poor student turns in a good one. A friendly student may
suddenly become hostile, or a hostile student may suddenly become friendly and cooperative. The instructor must fit
the tone, technique, and content of the critique to the occasion, as well as the student. A critique should be designed and
executed so that the instructor can allow for variables. An effective critique is one that is flexible enough to satisfy the
requirements of the moment.

20230
Acceptable—before students willingly accept their instructor’s criticism, they must first accept the instructor. Students
must have confidence in the instructor’s qualifications, teaching ability, sincerity, competence, and authority. If a critique is
presented fairly, with authority, conviction, sincerity, and from a position of recognizable competence, the student probably
accepts it as such. Instructors should not rely on their position to make a critique more acceptable to their students.

20231

-  Comprehensive—a comprehensive critique is not necessarily a long one, nor must it treat every aspect of the

performance in detail. The instructor must decide whether the greater benefit comes from a discussion of a few
major points or a number of minor points. The instructor might critique what most needs improvement, or only what
the student can reasonably be expected to improve. An effective critique covers strengths as well as weaknesses.

20232

-  Constructive—a critique is pointless unless the student profits from it. The instructor should give positive guidance

for correcting the fault and strengthening the weakness. Negative criticism that does not point toward improvement
or a higher level of performance should be omitted from a critique altogether.

20233

-  Organized—unless a critique follows some pattern of organization, a series of otherwise valid comments may lose

their impact. Almost any pattern is acceptable as long as it is logical and makes sense to the student as well as to the
instructor. An effective organizational pattern might be the sequence of the performance itself. Sometimes a critique
can profitably begin at the point where a demonstration failed and work backward through the steps that led to the
failure.

20234

-  Thoughtful—an effective critique reflects the instructor’s thoughtfulness toward the student’s need for self-esteem,

recognition, and approval from others. The instructor should never minimize the inherent dignity and importance


-----

of the individual. Ridicule, anger, or fun at the expense of the student have no place in a critique. While being
straightforward and honest, the instructor should always respect the student’s personal feelings.

20235

-  Specific—the instructor’s comments and recommendations should be specific, rather than general. The student

needs to focus on something concrete. If the instructor has a clear, well-founded, and supportable idea in mind, it
should be expressed with firmness and authority in terms that cannot be misunderstood.

**Evaluation**

20236
Whenever learning takes place, the result is a definable, observable, measurable change in behavior. The purpose of an
evaluation is to determine how a student is progressing in the course. Evaluation is concerned with defining, observing,
and measuring or judging this new behavior. Evaluation normally occurs before, during, and after instruction; it is an
integral part of the learning process. During instruction, some sort of evaluation is essential to determine what the student
is learning and how well they are learning it. The instructor’s evaluation may be the result of observations of the students’
overall performance, or it may be accomplished as either a spontaneous or planned evaluation, such as an oral quiz, written
test, or skill performance test. [ _Figure 10-13_ ]

20237

**Evaluation**

Knowledge Tests

Oral Quizzes

Performance Tests

**Figure 10-13.** _There are three common types of evaluations that instructors may use._

**Oral Quizzes**

20238
The most used means of evaluation is the direct or indirect oral questioning of the student by the instructor. Questions
may be loosely classified as fact questions and thought questions. The answer to a fact question is based on memory or
recall. This type of question usually concerns who, what, when, and where. Thought questions usually involve why or how,
and require the student to combine knowledge of facts with an ability to analyze situations, solve problems, and arrive at
conclusions. Proper quizzing by the instructor can have a number of desirable results.

**Characteristics of Effective Questions**

20239
An effective oral quiz requires some preparation. The instructor should devise and write pertinent questions in advance.
One method is to place them in the lesson plan. Prepared questions merely serve as a framework, and as the lesson
progresses, should be supplemented by such impromptu questions as the instructor considers appropriate. To be effective,
questions must apply to the subject of instruction. Unless the question pertains strictly to the particular training being


-----

conducted, it serves only to confuse the students and divert their thoughts to an unrelated subject. An effective question
should be brief and concise, but also clear and definite.

20240
Effective questions must be adapted to the ability, experience, and stage of training of the students. Effective questions
center on only one idea. A single question should be limited to who, what, when, where, how, or why, not a combination.
Effective questions must present a challenge to the students. Questions of suitable difficulty serve to stimulate learning.
Effective questions demand and deserve the use of proper English.

**_Answering Questions from Students_**

20241
Responses to student questions must also conform with certain considerations if answering is to be an effective teaching
method. The question must be clearly understood by the instructor before an answer is attempted. The instructor should
display interest in the student’s question and frame an answer that is as direct and accurate as possible. After the instructor
completes a response, it should be determined whether or not the student’s request for information has been completely
answered, and if the student is satisfied with the answer.

20242
Occasionally, a student asks a question that the instructor cannot answer. In such cases, the instructor should freely admit
not knowing the answer, but should promise to get the answer or, if practicable, offer to help the student look it up in
available references.

**Written Tests**

20243
As evaluation devices, written tests are only as good as the knowledge and proficiency of the test writer. This section is
intended to provide the flight instructor with only the basic concepts of written test design.

**_Characteristics of a Good Test_**

20244
A test is a set of questions, problems, or exercises for determining whether a person has a particular knowledge or skill. A
test can consist of just one test item, but it usually consists of a number of test items. A test item measures a single objective
and calls for a single response. The test could be as simple as the correct answer to an essay question or as complex as
completing a knowledge or practical test. Regardless of the underlying purpose, effective tests share certain characteristics.
For a full list of these characteristics, refer to the Aviation Instructor’s Handbook.

**Test Development**

20245
When testing aviation students, the instructor is usually concerned more with criterion-referenced testing than normreferenced testing. Criterion-referenced testing evaluates each student’s performance against a carefully written,
measurable, standard or criterion. Norm-referenced testing measures a student’s performance against the performance of
other students. There is little or no concern about the student’s performance in relation to the performance of other students.
The FAA knowledge and practical tests for pilots are all criterion referenced because in aviation training it is necessary to
measure student performance against a high standard of proficiency consistent with safety.

**_Pre-solo Knowledge Tests_**

20246
Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 61 requires the satisfactory completion of a pre-solo knowledge
test prior to solo flight. The pre-solo knowledge test is required to be administered, graded, and all incorrect answers
reviewed by the instructor providing the training prior to endorsing the student pilot log book. The regulation states that
the pre-solo knowledge test must include questions applicable to 14 CFR parts 61 and 91 and on the flight characteristics
and operational limitations of the make and model aircraft to be flown.

20247
The content and number of test questions are to be determined by the flight instructor. An adequate sampling of the general
operating rules should be included. In addition, a sufficient number of specific questions should be asked to ensure the
student has the knowledge to safely operate the aircraft in the local environment.


-----

Specific procedures for developing test questions are covered in the Aviation Instructor’s Handbook, but a review of some
items as they apply to the pre-solo knowledge test are in order. Though selection-type (usually referred to as multiplechoice) test items are easier to grade, it is recommended that supply-type (or “fill in the blank”) test items be used for the
portions of the pre-solo knowledge test where specific knowledge is to be tested. One problem with supply-type test items
is difficulty in assigning the appropriate grade.

20249
Since solo flight requires a thorough working knowledge of the different conditions likely to be encountered on the
solo flight, it is important that the test properly evaluate this area. In this way, the instructor can see any areas that are
not adequately understood and can then cover them in the review of the test. Selection-type test items do not allow the
instructor to evaluate the student’s knowledge beyond the immediate scope of the test items. The supply-type test item
measures much more adequately the knowledge of the student, and lends itself very well to pre-solo testing.

20250
The instructor must keep a record of the test results for at least three (3) years, as required by the provisions of 14 CFR part
61, section 61.189. The record should at least include the date, name of the student, and the results of the test.

**_Performance Tests_**

20251
The flight instructor does not administer the practical test for a pilot certificate. Flight instructors do get involved with the
same skill or performance testing that is measured in these tests. Performance testing is desirable for evaluating training
that involves an operation, a procedure, or a process. The job of the instructor is to prepare the student to take these tests.
Therefore, each element of the practical test has been evaluated prior to an applicant taking the practical exam.

20252
The purpose of the practical test standards (PTS)/ Airman Certification Standards (ACS) is to delineate the standards
by which FAA inspectors and designated pilot examiners conduct tests for ratings and certificates. The standards are
in accordance with the requirements of 14 CFR parts 61 and 91 and other FAA publications including the Aeronautical
Information Manual and pertinent advisory circulars and handbooks. The objective of the PTS/ACS is to ensure the
certification of pilots at a high level of performance and proficiency, consistent with safety.

20253
Since every task in the PTS/ACS may be covered on the check ride, the instructor must evaluate all of the tasks before
certifying the applicant to take the practical test. While this evaluation is not totally formal in nature, it should adhere to
criterion-referenced testing. Although the instructor should always train the student to the very highest level possible, the
evaluation of the student is only in relation to the standards listed in the PTS/ACS. The instructor, and the examiner, should
also keep in mind that the standards are set at a level that is already very high. They are not minimum standards and they
do not represent a floor of acceptability. In other words, the standards are the acceptable level that must be met and there
are no requirements to exceed them.

**Planning Instructional Activities**

20254
Any instructional activity must be well planned and organized if it is to proceed in an effective manner. Much of the basic
planning necessary for the flight instructor is provided by the knowledge and proficiency requirements published in 14
CFR, approved school syllabi, and the various texts, manuals, and training courses available. This section reviews the
planning required by the instructor as it relates to four key topics—course of training, blocks of learning, training syllabus,
and lesson plans.

**Course of Training**

20255
In education, a course of training may be defined as a complete series of studies leading to attainment of a specific goal.
The goal might be a certificate of completion, graduation, or an academic degree. For example, a student pilot may enroll
in a private pilot certificate course, and upon completion of all course requirements, be awarded a graduation certificate.

20256
Other terms closely associated with a course of training include curriculum, syllabus, and training course outline. In many
cases, these terms are used interchangeably, but there are important differences.


-----

A curriculum may be defined as a set of courses in an area of specialization offered by an educational institution. A
curriculum for a pilot school usually includes courses for the various pilot certificates and ratings. A syllabus is a brief
or general summary or outline of a course of study. In aviation, the term “training syllabus” is commonly used. In this
context, a training syllabus is a step-by-step, building block progression of learning with provisions for regular review
and evaluations at prescribed stages of learning. The syllabus defines the unit of training, states by objective what the
student is expected to accomplish during the unit of training, shows an organized plan for instruction, and dictates the
evaluation process for either the unit or stages of learning. And, finally, a training course outline, within a curriculum, may
be described as the specific content of a particular course. It normally includes statements of objectives, descriptions of
teaching aids, definitions of evaluating criteria, and indications of desired outcome.

**Objectives & Standards**

5050
The overall objective of an aviation training course is usually well established, and the general standards are included
in various rules and related publications. For example, eligibility, knowledge, proficiency, and experience requirements
for pilots and AMT learners are stipulated in the regulations, and the standards are published in the applicable Airman
Certification Standards (ACS)/Practical Test Standards (PTS) or oral and practical tests (O&Ps). It should be noted that
ACS/PTS and O&P standards are limited to the specific job tasks or subjects. Certification tests do not represent an entire
training syllabus.

**Blocks of Learning**

20259
After the overall training objectives have been established, the next step is the identification of the blocks of learning

[ _Figure 10-14_ ] which constitute the necessary parts of the total objective. Just as in building a pyramid, some blocks are
submerged in the structure and never appear on the surface, but each is an integral and necessary part of the structure.
During the process of identifying the blocks of learning to be assembled for the proposed training activity, the planner must
also examine each carefully to see that it is truly an integral part of the structure.

**Figure 10-14.** _The pre-solo stage, or phase, of private training is comprised of several basic building blocks. These blocks of learning,_

_which should include coordinated ground and flight training, lead up to the first solo._

5395
While determining the overall training objectives is a necessary first step in the planning process, early identification of
the foundation blocks of learning is also essential. Training for any such complicated and involved task as piloting or
maintaining an aircraft requires the development and assembly of many segments or blocks of learning in their proper
relationships. In this way, a learner can master the segments or blocks individually and can progressively combine these
with other related segments until their sum meets the overall training objectives.


-----

**Training Syllabus**

20262
There are a number of valid reasons why all flight instructors should use a training syllabus. As technology advances,
training requirements become more demanding. At the same time, new and often more complicated rules continue to
be proposed and implemented. In addition, the rules for instruction in other than an approved flight school are still quite
specific about the type and duration of training. These factors, along with the continuing growth of aviation, add to the
complexity of aviation training and certification.

20263
Instructors need a practical guide to help them make sure the training is accomplished in a logical sequence and that all
of the requirements are completed and properly documented. A well organized, comprehensive syllabus can fulfill these
needs.

**Syllabus Format & Content**

20264
The format and organization of the syllabus may vary, but it always should be in the form of an abstract or digest of the
course of training. It should contain blocks of learning to be completed in the most efficient order.

20265
Since a syllabus is intended to be a summary of a course of training, it should be fairly brief, yet comprehensive enough
to cover essential information. This information is usually presented in an outline format with lesson-by-lesson coverage.
Some syllabi include tables to show recommended training time for each lesson, as well as the overall minimum time
requirements.

5405
Since effective training relies on organized blocks of learning, all syllabi should stress well-defined objectives and standards
for each lesson. Appropriate objectives and standards should be established for the overall course, the separate ground and
flight segments, and for each stage of training. Other details may be added to a syllabus in order to explain how to use it and
describe the pertinent training and reference materials. Examples of the training and reference materials include textbooks,
websites, video, compact discs, exams, briefings, and instructional guides.

**How to Use a Training Syllabus**

20267
Any practical training syllabus must be flexible, and should be used primarily as a guide. When necessary, the order
of training can and should be altered to suit the progress of the student and the demands of special circumstances. For
example, previous experience or different rates of learning often require some alteration or repetition to fit individual
students. The syllabus also should be flexible enough so it can be adapted to weather variations and scheduling changes
without disrupting the teaching process or completely suspending training.

20268
Effective use of a syllabus requires that it be referred to throughout the entire course of training. Both the instructor and
the student should have a copy of the approved syllabus. However, as previously mentioned, a syllabus should not be
adhered to so stringently that it becomes inflexible or unchangeable. It must be flexible enough to adapt to special needs
of individual students.

20269
A syllabus lesson may include several other items that add to or clarify the objective, content, or standards. A lesson
may specify the recommended class time, reference or study materials, recommended sequence of training, and study
assignment for the next lesson. Both ground and flight lessons may have explanatory information notes added to specific
lessons.

5415
While a syllabus is designed to provide a road map showing how to accomplish the overall objective of a course of training,
it may be useful for other purposes. As already mentioned, it can be used as a checklist to ensure that required training has
successfully been completed. Thus, a syllabus can be an effective tool for recordkeeping. Enhanced syllabi, which also are
designed for recordkeeping, can be very beneficial to the independent instructor.

20271
A recordkeeping function may be facilitated by boxes or blank spaces adjacent to the knowledge areas, procedures, or
maneuvers in a flight lesson, much as the syllabus designed by the Balloon Federation of America does. Most syllabi
introduce each procedure or maneuver in one flight lesson and review them in subsequent lessons. Some syllabi also include
provisions for grading student performance and recording both ground and flight training time. Accurate recordkeeping is


-----

necessary to keep both the student and the instructor informed on the status of training. These records also serve as a basis
for endorsements and recommendations for knowledge and practical tests.

20272
Another benefit of using a syllabus is that it helps in development of lesson plans. A well constructed syllabus already
contains much of the essential information that is required in a lesson plan, including objectives, content, and completion
standards.

**Lesson Plans**

20273
A lesson plan is an organized outline for a single instructional period. [ _Figure 10-15_ ] It is a necessary guide for the
instructor in that it tells what to do, in what order to do it, and what procedure to use in teaching the material of a lesson.
Lesson plans should be prepared for each training period and be developed to show specific knowledge and/or skills to be
taught.

_ground training periods to be devoted to the lesson is specified. The lesson should include three key parts—objective, content, and_

_completion standards._

20275
A mental outline of a lesson is not a lesson plan. A lesson plan should be put into writing. Another instructor should be able
to take the lesson plan and know what to do in conducting the same period of instruction. When putting it in writing, the
lesson plan can be analyzed from the standpoint of adequacy and completeness.


-----

Lesson plans serve many purposes, such as:

20277

-  Assure a wise selection of material and the elimination of unimportant details.

20278

-  Make certain that due consideration is given to each part of the lesson.

20279

-  Aid the instructor in presenting the material in a suitable sequence for efficient learning.

20280

-  Provide an outline of the teaching procedure to be used.

20281

-  Serve as a means of relating the lesson to the objectives of the course of training.

20282

-  Give the inexperienced instructor confidence.

20283

-  Promote uniformity of instruction regardless of the instructor or the date on which the lesson is given.

**Characteristics of a Well-Planned Lesson**

20284
The quality of planning affects the quality of results. Successful professionals understand the price of excellence is hard
work and thorough preparation. The effective instructor realizes that the time and energy spent in planning and preparing
each lesson is well worth the effort in the long run. [ _Figure 10-16_ ]

20286
A complete cycle of planning usually includes several steps. After the objective is determined, the instructor must research
the subject as it is defined by the objective. Once the research is complete, the instructor must determine the method of
instruction and identify a useful lesson planning format. Other steps, such as deciding how to organize the lesson and
selecting suitable support material also must be accomplished. The final steps include assembling training aids and writing
the lesson plan outline. One technique for writing the lesson plan outline is to prepare the beginning and ending first. Then,
complete the outline and make revisions as necessary. The following are some of the important characteristics that should
be reflected in all well-planned lessons.


-----

-  Unity—each lesson should be a unified segment of instruction. A lesson is concerned with certain limited objectives,

which are stated in terms of desired student learning outcomes. All teaching procedures and materials should be
selected to attain these objectives.

20288

-  Content—each lesson should contain new material. However, the new facts, principles, procedures, or skills should

be related to the lesson previously presented. A short review of earlier lessons is usually necessary, particularly in
flight training.

5430

-  Scope—each lesson should be reasonable in scope. A person can master only a few principles or skills at a time,

the number depending on complexity. Presenting too much material in a lesson results in confusion; presenting too
little material results in inefficiency.

20290

-  Practicality—each lesson should be planned in terms of the conditions under which the training is to be conducted.

Lesson plans for training conducted in a balloon differ from those conducted in a classroom. Also, the kinds and
quantities of instructional aids available have a great influence on lesson planning and instructional procedures.

5432

-  Flexibility—although the lesson plan provides an outline and sequence for the training to be conducted, a degree of

flexibility should be incorporated. For example, the outline of content may include blank spaces for add-on material,
if required.

20292

-  Relation to course of training—each lesson should be planned and taught so that its relation to the course objectives

are clear to each student. For example, a lesson on short-field takeoffs and landings should be related to both the
certification and safety objectives of the course of training.

20293

-  Instructional Steps—every lesson, when adequately developed, lends itself to the four steps of the teaching process:

preparation, presentation, application, and review and evaluation.

**How to Use a Lesson Plan Properly**

39243

**_Be Familiar With the Lesson Plan_**

20295
The instructor should study each step of the plan and should be thoroughly familiar with as much information related to
the subject as possible.

**_Use the Lesson Plan as a Guide_**

20296
The lesson plan is an outline for conducting an instructional period. It assures that pertinent materials are at hand and that
the presentation is accomplished with order and unity. Having a plan prevents the instructor from getting off the track,
omitting essential points, and introducing irrelevant material. Students have a right to expect an instructor to give the same
attention to teaching that they give to learning. The most certain means of achieving teaching success is to have a carefully
thought-out lesson plan.

**_Adapt the Lesson Plan to the Class or Student_**

20297
In teaching a ground school period, the instructor may find that the procedures outlined in the lesson plan are not leading
to the desired results. In this situation, the instructor should change the approach. There is no certain way of predicting
the reactions of different groups of students. An approach that has been successful with one group may not be equally
successful with another.

**_Revise the Lesson Plan Periodically_**

20299
After a lesson plan has been prepared for a training period, a continuous revision may be necessary. This is true for a
number of reasons, including availability or non-availability of instructional aids, changes in regulations, new manuals and
textbooks, and changes in the state-of-the art among others.


-----

**Lesson Plan Formats**

20300
The format and style of a lesson plan depends on several factors. Certainly the subject matter has a lot to do with how a
lesson is presented and what teaching method is used. Individual lesson plans may be quite simple for one-on-one training,
or they may be elaborate and complicated for large, structured classroom lessons. Preferably, each lesson should have
somewhat limited objectives that are achievable within a reasonable period of time. This principle should apply to both
ground and flight training. As previously noted, aviation training is not simple.

20301
In spite of need for varied subject coverage, diverse teaching methods, and relatively high level learning objectives, most
aviation lesson plans have the common characteristics already discussed. They all should include objectives, content
to support the objectives, and completion standards. Various authorities often divide the main headings into several
subheadings, and terminology, even for the main headings, varies extensively. For example, completion standards may be
called assessment, review and feedback, performance evaluation, or some other related term.

**Chapter Summary**

20302
It is an unfortunate truth that many commercial balloon pilots are not as qualified and prepared for their instructional
responsibility as they should be. All commercial pilots are required to study the necessary principles of instruction in order
to pass their knowledge test, and must perform a lesson on a flight maneuver as a part of the practical test.

20303
A commercial pilot who chooses to instruct needs to hold himself to the same standards as the rest of the aviation
community. He should provide compete and thorough flight training, as well as insuring that proper ground training is
conducted, so that the prospective pilot is well-grounded in all facets of aviation. To do less minimizes the instructor’s role
in the educational process, and perpetuates poor training in the ballooning community

20304
The information in this chapter provides a basis for an instructor’s knowledge of the skills and techniques of the instructional
process. It is the responsibility of each individual instructor to expand on that knowledge, and provide the best instruction
possible.
