# Chapter 2: Hot Air Balloon Design, Systems, & Theory

**Introduction**

18743
This chapter presents an introduction to the history of flying balloons, the physics of balloon flight, balloon components,
balloon terminology, support equipment, and how to choose a balloon.

**History**

18744
Hot air balloons are the oldest successful human flight technology. The first recorded manned balloon flight was made on
November 21, 1783, in a hot air balloon developed by the Montgolfier brothers of France. [ _Figure 2-1_ ] Flown by Pilatre
de Rozier and the Marquis d’Arlandes, the flight lasted 23 minutes and covered 5.5 miles. Although the Montgolfiers are
given credit for the first documented flight, there are some earlier claims. The Chinese are credited with using manned
kites, and perhaps hot air balloons, some 2,000 years ago, and the Nazcas of Peru may have used smoke-filled balloons.

18745

18746
Ten days after the successful flight of the Montgolfier balloon, a young physicist, Professor Jacques Charles flew the first gas
balloon made of a varnished silk envelope filled with hydrogen. His flight lasted two hours and covered 27 miles, reaching
an altitude of 9,000 feet. Begun as an attempt to duplicate and validate the achievements of the Montgolfier brothers,
Charles based his experiment on misinformation. He mistakenly believed the Montgolfier brothers used hydrogen to
inflate their balloon, so he used hydrogen. Thus, the two kinds of balloons flown today—hot air and gas—were developed
in the same year.

18747
Gas ballooning became a sport for the affluent and flourished on a small scale in Europe and the United States. Since
ballooning drew crowds, one way to offset the cost of a flight was to charge admission. Ballooning was a perilous


-----

undertaking that drew male and female daredevils eager to court danger. The parachute, invented by balloonist Andre
Garnerin in 1797 as the means of performing a daring stunt, is probably ballooning’s most significant contribution to flight.

18748
At the turn of the century, the smoke balloon (a canvas envelope heated by fire on the ground) was a common county fair
opening event. As the smoke balloon ascended, a man or woman rider balanced on a trapeze attached to the balloon.

18749
After the initial climb (about 3,000 feet per minute (fpm)) the hot air cooled and the rider separated from the balloon,
deploying a parachute to return to earth.

18750
Balloons also found a home with the military. Napoleon used anchored observation balloons in some of his battles and
considered using balloons to ferry troops in his proposed invasion of England. During the American Civil War, both the
North and South used tethered observation balloons. In Europe, balloons were used during the 1870 siege of Paris (FrancoPrussian War) to carry messages and important people out of Paris. World War I saw balloons used by both sides for
artillery spotting. By World War II, airplanes had replaced balloons for observation and reconnaissance purposes although
barrage balloons (several large balloons tethered close together) were often used to discourage low level bombers or dive
bombers. The United States Navy contracted with the General Mills Company in the 1950s to develop a small hot air
balloon for military purposes. The Navy never used the balloon, but the project created the basis for the modern hot air
balloon. With the use of modern materials and technology, hot air ballooning has become an increasingly popular sport.

**Physics**

18751
In concept, the balloon is the simplest of all flying machines. It consists of a fabric envelope filled with a gas that is lighter
than the surrounding atmosphere. Since air in the envelope is less dense than its surroundings, it rises, taking the basket
filled with passengers or payload with it. A balloon is distinct from other aircraft in that it travels by moving with the wind
and cannot be propelled through the air in a controlled manner.

18752
There are two main types of balloons, hot air and gas, but other specialty type balloons are also flown. The Rozier balloon
is an example of a less common balloon. A hybrid balloon that utilizes both heated and unheated lifting gases for long
distance record flights, a Rozier was flown by Steve Fossett in his record-setting first solo circumnavigation in 2002. A
recent addition to the hot air balloon field is the solar balloon, which uses heat radiation from the sun to provide lift. This
handbook primarily covers hot air balloons.

**Why Do Balloons Fly?**

18753
The physics of balloon flight is based on the principles of fluid dynamics and associated theorems. Therefore, it is helpful
to think of the air, the medium of balloon flight, as a fluid when discussing the concept of “buoyancy” as applied to balloon
flight. In physics, buoyancy is the upward force of an object produced by the surrounding fluid (i.e., liquid or gas) in which
it is fully or partially immersed, due to the pressure difference of the fluid between the top and bottom of the object. The
net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the object. This force enables the
object to float or at least to appear lighter. An object must make room for its own volume by pushing aside, or displacing,
an equal volume of liquid. For example, an aircraft carrier exerts downward force on the water and the water exerts upward
force on the aircraft carrier. A solid object floats when it has displaced just enough water, or air in the case of a balloon, to
equal its own original weight.

18754
To create the necessary buoyancy for flight, the air inside the balloon envelope is heated which causes the air to expand,
making it less dense. [ _Figure 2-2_ ] Once the interior air weighs less than the non-heated ambient air (air that surrounds an
object), the balloon becomes lighter in weight and rises in an effort to find a level where the interior air density matches
that of the exterior air density. The envelope is carried along “for the ride,” as it does little more than contain the heated
air mass. The balloon rises to a point where the lift created by the action of heating the air is equal or greater than that of
the balloon itself. The balloon rises because it has reached a state of “positive buoyancy” and the amount of lift is greater
than the weight of the balloon.


-----

**Figure 2-2.** _The air inside the balloon envelope is heated to create buoyancy._

18756
The greater the heat differential between the air inside the envelope and the ambient air, the faster the balloon rises. Hot
air is constantly being lost from the top of the envelope by leaking through the fabric, seams, and deflation port. Heat is
also lost by radiation. Only the best and newest fabrics are nearly airtight. Some fabrics become increasingly porous with
age and some colors radiate heat faster than others do. Under certain conditions, some dark colored envelopes may gain
heat from the sun. To compensate for heat loss, prolonged flight is possible only if fuel is carried on board to make heat.

18757
The internal temperature of the air in the envelope is raised or lowered to change altitude. To climb, the temperature in
the envelope is raised by heating the air which creates more lift. To descend, the air in the envelope is allowed to cool.
Cooling of the envelope is also possible by allowing hot air to escape through a vent. This temporary opening closes and
seals automatically, due to the upward pressure, when it is not in use.

18758
A balloon’s weight when in flight is not only the figure as stated in the flight manual, but also includes the weight of the
air within the inflated envelope, the balloon components and equipment, as well as the pilot and passengers. The average
77,000 cubic foot hot air balloon contains an air mass that weighs over 3,000 pounds. By adding all these factors together,
it is easy to understand how weight influences the balloon’s response to pilot actions during flight maneuvers. The weight
and sheer momentum of a balloon in flight make it difficult for a pilot to effect rapid changes.

**Balloon Components**

18759
A hot air balloon consists of three main components: envelope, heater system, and basket. In addition, flight instruments,
fuel tanks, and other support equipment are needed for a safe balloon flight. [ _Figure 2-3_ ] The most common ballooning
terms are used in the following text, in the generic illustrations, and are also listed in the glossary which contains balloon
and aeronautical terminology. Some terms and names used by manufacturers are also included.

**Figure 2-3.** _Basic balloon terms._

**Envelope**

18761
The envelope is usually made of light-weight and strong synthetic fabrics such as ripstop nylon or Dacron®. The material
is cut into panels which are sewn together in vertical rows that are called gores due to their triangular shape. The traditional
envelope shape is a teardrop. The gores are reinforced with sewn-in webbing called horizontal and vertical structural load
tapes which are continuous to the top center of the balloon where they are sewn into a load ring. Galvanized, stainless steel,
or Kevlar® cables transfer basket loads to load tapes which in turn support the load. The nylon “skirt” at the base of the
envelope is coated with special fire resistant material to keep the flame from igniting the balloon.

18762
The deflation port is located at the top of the envelope and allows for the controlled release of hot air. It is covered by the
deflation panel sometimes called a top cap, parachute top, or spring top. [ _Figure 2-4_ ] In a balloon with a parachute top,
partial opening of the parachute valve is the normal way to cool the balloon. Balloons with other types of deflation panels
may have a cooling vent in the side or the top. Many balloons are also equipped with turning vents, which allow for the
pilot to turn the balloon on its vertical axis while in flight. Turning vents help a pilot align the basket for landing, or in the
case of commercial balloons, align the balloon’s logo toward the crowd.

**_Special Shape Balloons_**

18764
Balloons that do not have a traditional “teardrop” shape are called special shape balloons. [ _Figure 2-5_ ] They may be
completely engineered systems which have been designed to resemble cans, sports balls, cartoon characters, cars, etc.

18765

**Figure 2-5.** _Special shape balloons_

18766
Some balloons have appendages added to the envelope. Appendages are pieces added to a balloon envelope in order
to create a particular shape or rendition, not necessarily keeping with a standard shape balloon. To be designated an
appendaged envelope, less than 10 percent of the total capacity of the balloon is contained within the appendage. While the
appendaged envelope has the same general flight characteristics as a standard balloon shape, there are some differences.


-----

For example, the added weight of the appendage may cause the overall envelope to weigh significantly more than teardrop
balloons of equal size. Appendage balloons also have the tendency to rotate during aggressive climbs and descents.

18767
A special shape envelope requires a substantial amount of engineering to ensure the envelope is properly stressed, and the
balloon has no undesirable flight characteristics due to the shape. Special shape balloons built in the United States or the
United Kingdom are normally issued Standard Airworthiness Certificates, but special shape balloons imported from other
manufacturers in other countries may be issued an Experimental Airworthiness Certificate. A balloon with an Experimental
Airworthiness Certificate usually may not be flown for compensation or hire, which negates the marketability of such a
balloon. Additionally, an experimental balloon may not be flown over congested areas, per Title 14 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (14 CFR) part 91, section 91.319. Experimental balloons also require specific documentation when flown
outside of an area of 50 miles from its home port. Pilots of special shape balloons with an Experimental Airworthiness
Certificate should coordinate their activities with their local Flight Service District Office to avoid problems

**Thermal Airships**

18768
A thermal airship combines the characteristics of a hot air balloon, with respect to lifting force, and an airship, with respect
to its capacity of being steered while in flight. To develop proficiency in this aircraft, knowledge is required of not only
hot air balloon operations and physics, but also of airship operations. It is estimated that there are currently less than 10 of
these aircraft in the United States, and there is no specific pilot certificate for thermal airships. These aircraft are extremely
expensive to purchase, and have some significant operating limitations with reference to winds. Any further discussion is
outside the scope of this handbook.

**Heater System**

18769
The heater system consists of propane burners (one or more), fuel tanks that store liquid propane, and fuel lines that carry
the propane from the tanks to the burners. The burners convert ambient air into hot air, which in turn provides the lift
required for flight. [ _Figure 2-6_ and _Figure 2-7_ ]

18772
Propane fuel is used to heat the air which generates buoyancy for flight. The propane is stored in one or more fuel tanks
located in the basket. A withdrawal tube attached to the liquid tank valve permits liquid propane to be drawn from the
bottom of the fuel tanks. The liquid propane is supplied to the burner assembly through the fuel hoses that connect the fuel
tanks to the heater assembly (commonly referred to as the burner). The fuel system also provides propane to the pilot light.

18773
There are two types of pilot light systems: liquid and vapor. In a liquid pilot light system, liquid propane is diverted from
the main supply line at the heater via a pilot shut-off valve. The fuel goes through a vapor converter and regulator, and is
distributed through a pilot head. A piezo-electric system ignites the vapor at inflation for most heaters, but many balloonists
choose to use a striker.

18774
In a vapor pilot light, a second fuel hose is used to supply vapor to the heater assembly pilot light from the pilot light tank
valve located on top of the fuel tank. A regulator is used to decrease the pressure of the propane vapor for proper pilot
operation. A pilot light valve located on the heater controls the flow of propane vapor to the pilot light.

18775
The main liquid tank valve controls the flow of liquid propane to the burner, while the blast valve controls fuel flow at the
heater. With the liquid tank valve open, opening the burner blast permits liquid propane to enter the heat exchange coil
where it is either completely or partially vaporized. After exiting the heat exchange coil through the orifices in the lower
portion of the coil, the propane is ignited by the pilot light. [ _Figure 2-8_ ]

18777
To meet redundancy requirements, heaters have a secondary system which allows for operation at a reduced efficiency
should a problem develop with the main blast valve. These backup, or bypass systems generally have proprietary names
unique to the individual manufacturers. Pilots should consult individual flight manuals for an explanation of their use.

18778
The heaters typically have an output of approximately 20 million British thermal units (BTU) in use. There is a power loss
associated with altitude, generally considered to be four percent per thousand feet of altitude. This is particularly important
when dealing with higher density altitudes. Pilots accustomed to flying at lower altitudes are frequently surprised by the
decreased performance of their balloon upon their first flight at a higher altitude.

18779
Wicker is the preferred material for the passenger compartment basket of a hot air balloon because it is sturdy, flexible, and
relatively lightweight. [ _Figure 2-9_ ] The flexibility of wicker helps with balloon landings and cushions some of the impact
force at landing. The basket contains the fuel tanks, instruments, pilot, and passengers.


-----

**Figure 2-9.** _Representative sport basket configuration._

18781
Aluminum, stainless steel, or flexible nylon poles (in conjunction with stainless steel cables) located on the upper portion
of the structure transfer the basket load to the envelope attachment points and support the burner assembly. Quick pins or
aircraft bolts connect the support tubes, with nylon rods usually inserted into the sockets, and the cables attached around
them. Lower frame tubes support the floor, permitting the floor load to be transferred to the lower frames. Oak skids,
usually affixed to the floor, add rigidity and provide a point of abrasive resistance to the floor. Rattan sidewalls of varying
thickness, design, and color surround and protect the passengers, equipment, and fuel tanks. Larger baskets, usually found
on large ride balloons, may have padded basket dividers to form passenger compartments.

**Instruments**

18782
As required by 14 CFR part 31, balloons are equipped with an altimeter, a rate of climb indicator, fuel quantity gauges, and
an envelope temperature gauge. Many newer balloons use some type of electronic instrument system, but older balloons
may still be equipped with traditional, pressure driven analog instruments.

18783
The most common arrangement of instruments is a small pod or package which includes the altimeter, rate of climb
indicator (variometer or vertical speed indicator), and the envelope temperature gauge (pyrometer). A cable is plugged into
the instrument package during the preflight or layout process which connects to a sensor located in the top of the balloon
and operates the envelope temperature gauge. Fuel quantity gauges, located on the top portion of each fuel tank, provide
a reference for the quantity of fuel remaining in the tank. As these gauges are mechanical, they are sometimes inaccurate,
and in most configurations do not read from 0 to 100 percent. This needs to be taken into consideration during the flight
planning process.

18784
In recent years, many manufacturers have added a wireless system that transmits the temperature signal to a receiver in the
basket via a radio or infrared signal. This eliminates the necessity of a wire being located in the balloon envelope. These
instrument systems are popular, but have reliability issues because radio interference or the thermal “plume” from the
burner can degrade the signal transmission.


-----

**Fuel Tanks**

18785
Balloons generate heat through the use of propane. The propane is contained in aluminum or stainless steel tanks mounted
inside the basket. These tanks may be either vertical or horizontal, and contain 10, 15, or 18 gallons of propane. Larger
tanks are available for larger ride balloons. [ _Figure 2-10_ ]

**Figure 2-10.** _Typical fuel tank_

18787
The tanks, sometimes referred to as pressure vessels, are commonly equipped with a service valve (or main liquid valve), a
fixed maximum liquid level gauge (or “spit valve”), a float gauge, and a pressure relief valve. The service valve regulates
the flow of the liquid propane to the heater. The fixed maximum liquid level gauge provides an indication that the tank is
filled to its maximum design quantity, or 80 percent of the total capacity of the tank. The float gauge provides a reading of
the remaining capacity of the tank in a percentage. The pressure relief valve allows for the release of propane from the tank
should the tank exceed the maximum design pressure. A pressure relief valve normally releases at 375 pounds per square
inch (psi). _Figure 2-11_ provides additional information on propane management.


-----

**Propane Primer**

Propane is a liquefied petroleum gas. Propane is preferred over butane and other hydrocarbons in balloon
design because propane has a lower boiling point (propane -44 °F, butane 32 °F), and, therefore, a
consistently higher vapor pressure for a given temperature. Under ideal circumstances, a gallon of propane
produces 91,600 BTU of heat.

In its gaseous form, propane is odorless. However, an odorant (a strong smelling chemical compound) is
added to propane to indicate the leakage of even small quantities of gas. The odorant normally added to
propane, ethyl mercaptan, loses its odor when burned. Tanks should never be stored in an enclosed area,
or near a heater and/or a device with a pilot light. Propane vapor is heavier than air, and will collect in low
areas. Concentrated propane vapor constitutes an explosive hazard.

There is a popular misconception that propane is always at -44 °F when stored. This is incorrect—the
propane, in the tank, is the same temperature as the ambient air. Propane turns cold when vaporizing, due
to heat exchange.

The combustion of propane yields carbon dioxide and water.

The balloonist should be aware of the large volume of combustible mixture that will result from the escape
of a small amount of liquid propane. As a rough approximation, a given volume of liquid propane produces
a combustible mixture 6,800 times the original liquid propane volume.

The propane cylinder raises the boiling point of propane by trapping the pressure built up by the vaporized
propane. Any given temperature will produce a specific pressure within the propane cylinder. This balance
between temperature and pressure is referred to as the point of equilibrium. As long as the propane
cylinder is neither completely full nor completely empty of the liquefied fuel, and no foreign substance such
as air is present, the pressure within the cylinder is dependent upon the prevailing temperature of the liquid,
and not upon the amount of liquid propane within the cylinder. Therefore, maintaining a proper propane
temperature is necessary to supply sufficient fuel pressure to the burner. The temperature-pressure point
of equilibrium is only applicable to containers containing vapor over the liquid. While propane vapor is
easily compressible, propane liquid is practically incompressible.

Butane-propane mixtures can be a problem. At certain times of the year in certain areas, butane will be
mixed with propane to increase its boiling point. A butane-propane mixture will produce a more yellow,
sooty flame, may tend to go out when the blast valve is pulled, and the pressure available for a given
temperature will be less.

Burners commonly used in hot air balloons are vaporizer burners. A vaporizer burner combines a vaporizer
with a burner into a single unit where burner heat is used to vaporize the liquid propane being fed into the
burner. The vaporizer normally consists of a coil in direct contact with the burner flame. If there is no fuel
flow through one of the coils during burner operation, the coil may be damaged as a result of overheating.

The heat output of a burner is one of the parameters that indicate how a given balloon will perform in flight.
A long sustained burn will produce a lower rating that the same time increment broken up into short burns.
The lower output for a sustained burn is due to the inertia of the fuel, the friction hindering fuel flow, and
pressure decay due to the withdrawal of liquid propane from the cylinder.

Periodic inspections of the airborne heating system should include a visual inspection of the hoses and
fittings, and a high pressure leak check with a test gauge adaptor.

**Support Equipment**

18789
Standard support equipment for ballooning includes an inflation fan, transport/chase vehicle, and small miscellaneous
items, such as igniters, drop lines, gloves, spare parts, and helmets.

**_Inflation Fans_**

18790
The inflation fan is one of the most dangerous pieces of equipment in ballooning.[ _Figure 2-12_ ] Keep this fact in mind when
purchasing and operating any inflation fan. Fan blades have been known to shatter or break, throw rocks at high velocity,


-----

and inadequate cages or guards fail to protect fingers and hands. Any fan considered for purchase by a prospective pilot
should be evaluated for potential safety hazards. Also, remember that the blade spinning at high revolutions per minute
(rpm) generates a significant gyroscopic effect. Fans should not be moved while running. If the fan must be moved, it
should be shut off, repositioned, and restarted.

18791

**Figure 2-12.** _Balloon inflation using a typical inflation fan._

18792
Fans come in different styles and sizes. Personal finances, style of inflation, and size of the balloon determines the best fan.
Points to consider in selecting a fan are:

18793

-  Weight—someone has to lift the fan into and out of the transport vehicle. Wheels help one person move the fan, but

they add to the weight and are not helpful on soft ground. One person can carry a small fan, but a larger fan may
require two people.

18794

-  Safety—fan blades today can be wood, aluminum, fiberglass, or composite, with wood being the most popular.

Wood or aluminum blades designed specifically for balloon fan use are best. The fan should have a cowling of
fiberglass or metal because a cage or grill alone is not sufficient to stop rocks or pieces of blade from being thrown.

18795

-  Transport—available space in a pickup truck, the back of a van, or on a trailer may determine the size of the fan.

18796

-  Cubic feet per minute (CFM)—fan blade design, duct design, and engine speed determine the amount of air moved

in a given time. Do not confuse engine size with CFM. Larger engines do not necessarily push more air. The volume
of air moved is primarily a function of blade design and performance. Moving a high volume of air is not necessarily
the ultimate goal in fan performance. Some people prefer a slower cold inflation to accommodate a thorough
preflight inspection.

18797

-  Fuel—gasoline degrades in storage. Do not store gasoline in the fan due to fire hazard and the formation of varnish,

which can clog fuel passages.

18798

-  Fan maintenance—a good fan requires little maintenance and should be easy to maintain. Check the oil periodically

and change it once a year. Check hub bolts and grill screws for tightness on a regular basis.

**_Transport/Chase Vehicle_**

18799
Balloon ground transportation varies. [ _Figure 2-13_ ] The most common vehicles are a van with the balloon carried inside,
a pickup truck with the balloon carried in the bed, or a van or pickup truck with a small trailer (flatbed or covered). Some
considerations in selecting a transport/chase vehicle are:

18800

-  Finances—if costs are an issue, a trailer hitch on the family sedan and a small flatbed trailer may work just fine.


-----

-  Convenience—for ease of handling the balloon, a small flatbed trailer low to the ground makes the least lifting

demands on the pilot and crew. One consideration is that volunteer crew members may have little or no experience
in backing a small trailer.

18802

-  Number of crew members—if the number of crew members is small, handling the balloon should be made as easy

as possible. If the number of crew members is large, the size of the chase vehicle and other factors may be more
important.

18803

-  Storage—some balloonists, who do not have room for inside storage and want security on the road, choose an

enclosed trailer. If an enclosed trailer is used for storage of the balloon, the trailer should be a light color to help
reduce the heat inside. Keeping the trailer cool keeps the tank pressure within reasonable limits (so as not to
aggravate a potential fuel leak), and reduces the vaporization of gasoline in the fan tank (the fumes can attack the
composition of the balloon’s fabric and render it unairworthy).

18804

-  Vehicle suitability—terrain, vehicle road clearance, and number of chase crew members are factors that determine

the suitability of a transport/chase vehicle.

18805

**Figure 2-13.** _This is an example of a transport vehicle which carries a small balloon, three adults, a 20-inch inflation fan, and all_

_other necessary equipment._

**_Quick/Safety Release_**

18806
Safety restraints, referred to as “quick releases” or “safety tie downs,” are used in balloon inflations. They are designed to
restrain the balloon from movement in breezy or windy conditions.

18807
There are several different types of safety restraints available, but none are part of the aircraft certification process. This
lack of aircraft certification has led to controversy over the use of safety restraints among ballooning enthusiasts. Since
event participation often requires their use for safety reasons, the use of safety restraints is now recommended for balloon


-----

launches. Each type of restraint has its own advantages and disadvantages which a pilot can learn via observation and
discussion with an instructor and/or other balloon pilots. When a pilot decides to utilize a safety restraint, it is important to
follow the balloon manufacturer’s recommendations on how to attach it to the balloon superstructure. Many balloons have
been seriously damaged by using an improperly attached restraint in excessive winds.

18808
It is also important to insure that all personnel involved with the inflation, whether pilot, crew or spectator, be aware of
the dangers of a safety restraint. The quick release rates with the inflation fans as one of the most hazardous pieces of
equipment on the launch field. Early release under load, or breaking of the safety restraint may cause serious injury. All
personnel involved should be briefed and made aware of the potential hazards.

**_Miscellaneous Items_**

18809

-  Radios—most pilots use some kind of two-way radio for air to ground communication. There are many choices

available, ranging from Family Radio Service (FRS) and General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) radios, which are
relatively low cost, to the more sophisticated FM business band systems, which can be expensive. The GMRS and
FM radios require licensing by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). FRS radios do not. Using cell
phones for air-ground communications is a violation of FCC rules.

18810

-  Igniters—most manufacturers provide at least two sources of ignition on board. The best igniter is the simple

welding striker. Nearly all balloons have builtin piezo ignition systems.

18811

-  Fueling adapter—adapters are required to connect the balloon fuel tanks to the propane source. Pilots should carry

their own adapters to ensure the adapters are clean and not worn. Dirty and worn adapters may damage a fuel system.

18812

-  Compass—compasses are used to track pibals, check map orientations, and navigate the balloon. While almost any

good quality compass will do, the best kind to use is probably the sighting compass.

18813

-  Fire extinguisher—most balloons now come equipped with small fire extinguishers affixed to the basket. If one is

present, it will be inspected during the annual inspection. These fire extinguishers are often too small to extinguish
grass fires or serious basket fires caused by a propane leak. In the case of a propane-leak fire, turning off a valve
usually extinguishes the fire. This is a better use of pilot time than fumbling for a fire extinguisher that might not
extinguish the fire.

18814

-  First aid kit—the location and contents of first aid kits vary. Some pilots keep a small first aid kit in their balloon;

some keep one in the chase vehicle. A frequent topic at Safety Seminars, the contents of the kit often depend on the
area of the country in which the balloon is flown.

18815

-  Drop line—drop lines allow ground crew to assist the pilot in landing in a confined area, or to move the balloon to

an area better suited for deflation and retrieving. A good drop line has a quick release provision; is easy to deploy,
recover and store; and is easy for a person on the ground to handle. Webbing is a popular drop line material because
it is strong. Webbing is hard to roll up, but easy to store. Half-inch nylon braid is strong and is easily rolled into a
ball and put in a bag.

18816

-  Gloves—pilots and crew members should develop the habit of wearing gloves anytime they handle the balloon

and associated equipment. A well fitting pair of gloves can reduce the injuries that occur while handling balloon
equipment, such as rope, cables, bag handles, etc. In the case of a small fuel leak at a burner fitting, gloves can
minimize a potentially disastrous situation. Gloves should be made of light colored smooth leather to reflect/deflect
propane, and gauntlet style to cover the wrist. Avoid synthetic material which melts in heat and ventilated gloves
which let in flame or gas. A second pair of gloves, of appropriate rubberized material and looser fit, can be used to
conduct refueling operations.

18817

-  Helmets—balloon manufacturers usually mandate protective headgear be worn, especially in high wind conditions

to protect heads from impact injury. Store helmets in a bag that can be carried inside or outside the basket, depending
on number of passengers and available room.


-----

Spares—the following are recommended spares to carry in the chase vehicle or to have on hand:

18819

-  Local and aeronautical maps.

18820

-  Helium tank and pibals (pilot balloons).

18821

-  Quick pins and carabiners.

18822

-  Gloves and helmets.

18823

-  Envelope fabric and/or patches.

18824

-  Refueling adapters.

18825

-  Spare tire for the trailer.

18826

-  Extra fuel for the fan.

18827

-  Extra strikers/igniters.

**Aircraft Documents**

18828
Certain documents are needed onboard your aircraft.

**Airworthiness Certificate**

18829
An Airworthiness Certificate is issued by a representative of the FAA after the balloon has been inspected, is found to
meet the requirements of 14 CFR part 31, and is in condition for safe operation. The Airworthiness Certificate must be
displayed in the aircraft so it is legible to the passengers and crew whenever it is operated. [ _Figure 2-14_ ] The Airworthiness
Certificate is transferred with the aircraft except when it is sold to a foreign purchaser.

18830

**Figure 2-14.** _Standard Airworthiness Certificate._

18831
A Standard Airworthiness Certificate is issued for aircraft type certificated in the normal category for manned free balloons.
A Standard Airworthiness Certificate remains in effect as long as the aircraft receives the required maintenance and is
properly registered in the United States. Flight safety relies, in part, on the condition of the aircraft, which is determined
by inspections performed by mechanics, approved repair stations, or manufacturers who meet specific requirements. A
Special Airworthiness Certificate is issued for all aircraft certificated in other than the Standard classifications, such as
Experimental or Restricted. When purchasing an aircraft classified as other than Standard, it is recommended that the local


-----

FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) be contacted for an explanation of the pertinent airworthiness requirements
and the limitations of such a certificate.

**Certificate of Aircraft Registration**

18832
Before an aircraft can be flown legally, it must be registered with the FAA Civil Aviation Registry. The Certificate of
Aircraft Registration, which is issued to the owner as evidence of the registration, must be carried in the aircraft at all times.

[ _Figure 2-15_ ] The Certificate of Aircraft Registration cannot be used for operations when:

18833

-  The aircraft is registered under the laws of a foreign country.

18834

-  The aircraft’s registration is canceled at the written request of the holder of the certificate.

18835

-  The aircraft is totally destroyed or scrapped.

18836

-  The ownership of the aircraft is transferred.

18837

-  The holder of the certificate loses United States citizenship.

18838
When one of the events listed in 14 CFR part 47, section 47.41 occurs, the previous owner must notify the FAA by filling
in the back of the Certificate of Aircraft Registration, and mailing it to: Federal Aviation Administration Civil Aviation
Registry, AFS-750 P.O. Box 25504 Oklahoma City, OK 73125

18839
After compliance with 14 CFR part 47, section 47.41, the pink copy of the application for a Certificate of Aircraft
Registration is authorization to operate an unregistered aircraft for a period not to exceed 90 days. Since the aircraft
is unregistered, it cannot be operated outside the United States until a permanent Certificate of Aircraft Registration is
received and placed in the aircraft.

18840
**_Note:_** For additional information concerning the Aircraft Registration Application or the Aircraft Bill of Sale, contact the
nearest FSDO.

**Aircraft Owner/Operator Responsibilities**

18841
The registered owner/operator of an aircraft is responsible for certain items, such as:

9676

-  Having a current Airworthiness Certificate and a Certificate of Aircraft Registration in the aircraft.


-----

-  Maintaining the aircraft in an airworthy condition, including compliance with all applicable Airworthiness Directives.

18844

-  Assuring that maintenance is properly recorded.

17524

-  Keeping abreast of current regulations concerning the operation and maintenance of the aircraft.

18846

-  Notifying the FAA Civil Aviation Registry immediately of any change of permanent mailing address, or the sale or

export of the aircraft, or the loss of the eligibility to register an aircraft. (Refer to 14 CFR part 47, section 47.41.)

56045
For further information regarding Airworthiness Directives (ADs), type certificate owner responsibilities, and aircraft
owner/operator responsibilities, visit the [FAA website](https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/continued_operation/ad/gen_resp) .

56047
Aircraft registration expires three years after an aircraft was registered or last renewed. The registration renewal date-tofile is scheduled five months before the expiration.

56048
The application for registration renewal must be filed five months before registration expires to enable delivery of a new
certificate before the old certificate expires. This provides a safety margin for correcting application errors. Prompt filing
does not change the new expiration date.

**Aircraft Maintenance**

18847
Maintenance is defined as the preservation, inspection, overhaul, and repair of an aircraft, including the replacement of
parts. A properly maintained aircraft is a safe aircraft. In addition, regular and proper maintenance ensures that an aircraft
meets an acceptable standard of airworthiness throughout its operational life. Although maintenance requirements vary
for different types of aircraft, experience shows that aircraft need some type of preventive maintenance every 25 hours of
flying time or less, and minor maintenance at least every 100 hours. This is influenced by the kind of operation, climatic
conditions, storage facilities, age, and construction of the aircraft. Manufacturers provide maintenance manuals, parts
catalogs, and other service information that should be used in maintaining the aircraft.

**Balloon Inspections**

18848
14 CFR part 91 places primary responsibility on the owner or operator for maintaining a balloon in an airworthy condition.
Certain inspections must be performed on the balloon, and the owner must maintain the airworthiness of the balloon during
the time between required inspections by having any defects corrected. This typically means that fabric damage outside
the maximum allowable damage limits specified by the manufacturer must be repaired before the envelope can be deemed
airworthy and returned to service.

**_Annual Inspection_**

18849
Any balloon flown for business or pleasure and not flown for compensation or hire is required to be inspected at least
annually. The inspection must be performed by a certificated and appropriately rated repair station, by the manufacturer, or
by a certificated airframe and powerplant (A&P) mechanic who holds an Inspection Authorization (IA). The aircraft may
not be operated unless the annual inspection has been performed within the preceding 12 calendar months. A period of 12
calendar months extends from any day of a month to the last day of the same month the following year.

**_100-Hour Inspection_**

18850
All balloons used to carry passengers for hire must have received a 100-hour inspection within the preceding 100 hours of
time in service and have been approved for return to service. Additionally, an aircraft used for flight instruction for hire,
when provided by the person giving the flight instruction, must also have received a 100-hour inspection. This inspection
must be performed by an appropriately rated FAA certificated repair station, the aircraft manufacturer, or by an FAA
certificated A&P mechanic. An annual inspection, or an inspection for the issuance of an Airworthiness Certificate, may be
substituted for a required 100-hour inspection.


-----

**_Preflight Inspections_**

18851
The preflight inspection is a thorough and systematic means by which a pilot determines if the aircraft is airworthy and in
condition for safe operation. The balloon’s Flight Manual contains a section devoted to a systematic method of performing
a preflight inspection. For balloons, this inspection is usually a part of the layout and inflation process, and is greatly
aided by the use of a checklist. Again, the pilot must also be aware of maximum damage limitations as published by the
manufacturer.

**Preventative Maintenance**

18852
Preventive maintenance is considered to be simple or minor preservation operations and the replacement of small standard
parts, not involving complex assembly operations. Certificated pilots may perform preventive maintenance on any balloon
that is owned or operated by them. According to 14 CFR part 43, appendix A, preventive maintenance may be performed
by the owner/operator of an aircraft who holds at least an FAA Private Pilot Certificate with a balloon rating.

18853
The following is a partial list of preventive maintenance that may be performed by the owner/operator of a balloon:

18854

-  Replacing defective safety wiring or cotter keys.

18855

-  Lubrication not requiring disassembly.

18856

-  The making of small fabric repairs to envelopes (as defined in, and in accordance with, the balloon manufacturers’

instructions) not requiring load tape repair or replacement.

18857

-  Refinishing decorative coating of the basket when removal or disassembly of any primary structure or operating

system is not required.

18858

-  Applying preservative or protective material to components where no disassembly of any primary structure or

operating system is involved and where such coating is not prohibited or is not contrary to good practices.

18859

-  Repairing upholstery and decorative furnishings of the balloon basket interior when the repairing does not require

disassembly of any primary structure or operating system or interfere with an operating system or affect primary
structure of the aircraft.

18860

-  Replacing seats or seat parts with replacement parts approved for the aircraft, not involving disassembly of any

primary structure or operating system.

18861

-  Replacing prefabricated fuel lines.

18862

-  Replacing and servicing batteries.

18863

-  Cleaning of balloon burner pilots and main nozzles in accordance with balloon manufacturers’ instructions.

18864

-  Replacement or adjustment of nonstructural standard fasteners incidental to operations.

18865

-  The interchange of balloon baskets and burners on envelopes when the basket or burner is designated as

interchangeable in the balloon Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS), and the baskets and burners are specifically
designed for quick removal and installation.

**Repairs and Alterations**

9664
Repairs and alterations are classified as either major or minor. 14 CFR part 43, appendix A, describes the alterations and
repairs considered major. Major repairs or alterations shall be approved for return to service on FAA Form 337, Major
Repair and Alteration, by an appropriately rated certificated repair station, an FAA-certificated A&P mechanic holding
an Inspection Authorization (IA), or a representative of the Administrator. Minor repairs and minor alterations may be


-----

approved for return to service with a proper entry in the maintenance records by an FAA-certificated A&P mechanic or an
appropriately certificated repair station.

9665
For modifications of experimental aircraft, refer to the operating limitations issued to that aircraft. Modifications in
accordance with FAA Order 8130.2, may require the notification of the issuing authority.

**Airworthiness Directives (ADs)**

18868
A primary safety function of the FAA is to require correction of unsafe conditions found in an aircraft, aircraft engine,
propeller, or appliance when such conditions exist and are likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design.
The unsafe condition may exist because of a design defect, maintenance, or other causes. 14 CFR part 39, Airworthiness
Directives (ADs), define the authority and responsibility of the Administrator for requiring the necessary corrective action.
ADs are the means used to notify aircraft owners and other interested persons of unsafe conditions and to specify the
conditions under which the product may continue to be operated. ADs may be divided into two categories:

17514

1. Those of an emergency nature requiring immediate compliance prior to further flight.

18870

2. Those of a less urgent nature requiring compliance within a specified period of time.

18871
ADs are regulatory and shall be complied with unless a specific exemption is granted. It is the aircraft owner or operator’s
responsibility to ensure compliance with all pertinent ADs. 14 CFR part 91, section 91.417 requires a record to be maintained
that shows the current status of applicable ADs, including the method of compliance; the AD number and revision date, if
recurring; the time and date when due again; the signature; kind of certificate; and certificate number of the repair station or
mechanic who performed the work. For ready reference, many aircraft owners have a chronological listing of the pertinent
ADs in the back of their aircraft maintenance records.

**Choosing a Balloon**

18872
Many companies manufacture balloons that are typecertificated by the FAA. A type-certificated balloon has passed many
tests, has been approved by the FAA, and conforms to the manufacturer’s TCDS. Balloon size is rated by envelope volume
with categories defined in metric units. _Figure 2-16_ illustrates the most popular size ranges in use today (volumes are
provided in cubic meters, as well as cubic feet).

18873

**FAI** **Number**
**Cubic Meters** **Cubic Feet**
**Category** **of People**

AX5 900–1,200 1 31,779–42,372

AX6 1,200–1,600 1–2 42,372–56,372

AX7 1,600–2,200 2–4 56,496–77,682

AX8 2,200–3,000 4–7 77,682–105,930

AX9 3,000–4,000 6–10 105,930–141,240

**Figure 2-16.** _Popular balloon size ranges._

**Advantages of Balloon Sizes**

18874
Different balloon sizes offer different advantages. The size of the balloon purchased should be determined according
to planned use(s). Most pilots think smaller balloons are easier to handle, fly, and pack up. Bigger balloons use less
fuel, operate cooler, and last longer. Higher elevations or hotter climates or passengers indicate a larger balloon. Balloon
competitions and sport flying require a smaller balloon. [ _Figure 2-17_ ]

**Selecting a New or Used Balloon**

18876
The cost is the most obvious difference between new and used balloons. Some new pilots buy a used balloon to gain
proficiency, and then purchase a new balloon when they have a better idea of what they want or need.

18877
Prior to purchasing any used balloon, it is important to ensure that the balloon is airworthy, to avoid purchasing an aircraft
which may be nearing, or perhaps past, its useful life. Most balloon envelopes are constructed of fabrics that last well
into the 300–400 hour range, with some newer fabrics exceeding that life span. It would be prudent to have the balloon
inspected by a reputable repair station or qualified inspector prior to purchase.

**Balloon Brands**

18878
The level of after sales service available—locally and from the manufacturer—is an important criterion in deciding which
brand of balloon to purchase. Talk to local pilots and ask questions. How does the local balloon repair station feel about
different brands? Do they stock parts for only one brand? Does the manufacturer ship parts and fabric for balloons already
in the field, or do they reserve these parts and fabric for new production? Do they ground older model balloons for lack of
materials while new balloons are being built?

18879
There are other criteria that could be considered, such as altitude at which the balloon will be flying, climate, and
interchangeability of components, to give some examples. Before making the final decision, talk to people with different
kinds of balloons who do different kinds of flying. Crewing for different balloons is an excellent way to learn about
balloons and can help in the decision on what first balloon to purchase.

**Chapter Summary**

18880
This chapter gives the reader common terminology for use in the ballooning community. Many times, confusion exists
between the student pilot and the instructor, due to differences in terminology used, and it is hoped that the discussions here
resolve those issues. The reader also should have an understanding of the physics of hot-air ballooning, as well as a good
understanding of the support equipment involved with ballooning activities.

18881
Propane information has also been included in this chapter, and it is recommended that all pilots review this on a recurring
basis, perhaps as part of a yearly safety seminar. Additionally, proper documentation, and inspection requirements have
been covered. Each pilot should become knowledgeable in these areas.
