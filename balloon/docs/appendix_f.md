1. Pressures and Temperatures taken from U. S. Standard Atmosphere Supplements, 1966, ESSA,
NASA, USAF; Table 5.2, Geometric Altitudes, English Units
2. Tables assume no effects due to superheating or impurities in lifting gas supply.
3. Entire volume is assumed to be completely filled with lifting gas as would normally be the case on
initial ascent.
4. For all descending altitudes, or for partially full envelopes, use the gross lift shown for the altitude at
which the envelope would be completely full. This is called the pressure altitude and is equal to the
maximum altitude achieved during the flight, if the envelope was full at that altitude. Gross lift does
NOT change as balloon descends unless additional lifting gas is lost.
